# Guidance-docs restructure — progress

- Plan: `plans/docs/GUIDANCE_DOCS_RESTRUCTURE_PLAN.md`
- Roadmap: `plans/docs/DOCS_ROADMAP.md`
- Roadmap item: `docs/guidance-restructure`
- Also delivered by this ledger: roadmap item `docs/agent-standards`, now checked off
- Worktree: `C:\Users\TommySeery\source\repos\Concertable\.worktrees\Docs-guidance-docs`
- Branch: `Docs/GuidanceDocsRestructure`
- PR: #637 — **open working branch, NOT for merge** (see the standing constraint under Next Steps; it deletes 2,662 lines whose replacement is not yet correctly tiered). Label `skip-e2e`.
  commit). Updated for base currency three times on 2026-08-17: from **69 behind** and `DIRTY` (three doc
  conflicts resolved, below), from 2 behind after platform-sync #645 merged — a clean merge carrying only
  the `<ConcertablePlatformVersion>` bump `0.1.0-alpha.0.1055` → `0.1.0-alpha.0.1061` across the five
  service `Directory.Packages.props` — and from 10 behind at `2b04d57e2`.
- Shared repos **today**: `tomjseery/dotagents` — `standards/dotnet/` (20 docs) only; `tomjseery/react-agents` — `standards/react/` (9), created 2026-08-18 on `main`; `Concertable/agent-standards` — `standards/process/` (7) + `standards/dotnet/` (12) + `standards/react/` (8) + the `skill_router` hook, three plugins. All three repos CI green at `852e467` / `9cb5ea3` / `b6312f7`. `dotagents` and `agent-standards` are still on `Refactor/StandardsDomainTree` with PRs open and CI green (`dotagents#1`, `agent-standards#2`), neither merged. Target shape and the three purged wrong models: `## Topology` below.
- Dependency/package gates: no consumer migration to do, but this PR **will** trigger publish + platform sync — `publish-packages.yml` triggers on the coarse `paths: api/**`, which this branch's `api/**` markdown matches. MinVer republishes and a `chore/platform-sync-*` PR opens; non-breaking (no published type changed), so it should auto-merge green. Follow it to green anyway — whoever merges owns the sync.
- Last reconciled: 2026-08-19 — steps 1 and Tier 2 both landed. `dotagents` `852e467`, `react-agents` `9cb5ea3`, `agent-standards` `b6312f7`, all pushed and CI green; #637 at the re-home commit. Re-check currency at enqueue time

**Scope changed 2026-08-17: this is no longer a docs PR.** It now carries build behaviour
(`api/TestConventions.targets` gating every test project) and a PreToolUse hook, because Phase 6 must land
with the thinning rather than after it. `skip-e2e` is still correct — no Step 4 positive trigger: no UI
flow, no HTTP/gRPC contract, no published-package shape, no auth/routing change. But PR CI now matters far
more than it did, since the new targets file participates in every project's build.

## Current state

**All four tiers match the model. Nothing is merged.** The corpus is 56 docs across three standards repos,
each doc owned by exactly one router skill, delivered as five plugins and — on this machine — as junctions.
The in-repo docs hold only this system's roster of real types, contexts, clients, tables and pins.

| Repo | Head | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `tomjseery/dotagents` #1 | `852e467` | `standards/dotnet/` 20 docs · plugin `dotnet-standards` · 10 utility skills · `deploy-skills.ps1` |
| `tomjseery/react-agents` `main` | `9cb5ea3` | `standards/react/` 9 · plugin `react-standards` |
| `Concertable/agent-standards` #2 | `b6312f7` | `standards/process/` 7 + `dotnet/` 12 + `react/` 8 · plugins `agent-process` (owns the hook), `concertable-dotnet`, `concertable-react` |
| `Concertable/concertable` #637 | `72b692246` | the reduction — 55 CI checks pass, 5 skip. **Working branch, NOT for merge** |

**Auto-loaded floor.** An `api/**` prompt loads `api/AGENTS.md` (77) + `api/ARCHITECTURE.md` (62) with
**zero** `@`-imports, from 1,429 lines at the start of this plan. An `app/**` prompt loads
`app/AGENTS.md` (36), from 786. A unit-test project pulls in a 6-line stub; an E2E project none. Root
`AGENTS.md` is still 298 lines — its thinning is deliberately deferred to a follow-up PR.

**Enforcement is complete at three tiers and in both harnesses.** `api/TestConventions.targets` fails a
misnamed or misclassified test project; the write-time `skill_router.py` blocks the first write into a
routed path whichever harness makes it, resolving descriptions from plugin caches as well as junction
roots; `/review` resolves the standards it owes from the same `skill-routes.json`. Every route now names
both the generic skill and its Concertable counterpart.

**Deployed here:** 66 skills junctioned into both `~/.agents/skills` and `~/.claude/skills`, and 5
repo-scoped standards junctions at `~/.agents/standards/<repo>/<domain>/`. All **112** deployed routers
(56 × two roots) verified to open a byte-identical copy of their own repo's authored doc.

**The install is proven, in both harnesses (2026-08-18).** Plugins installed for real from a branch
worktree as a local-path marketplace; every `dotnet-standards` router resolved inside the plugin's own
copy, 20/20 in Claude and 20/20 in Codex. Claude copied the payload into a sha-versioned cache even from a
`Directory` source, confirming copies-not-references; Codex read `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`
natively while Claude used `.claude-plugin/`. The machine was restored to its pre-test snapshot. Measured
cost: ~5,242 always-on tokens per 20 router descriptions, ~90 per router on invoke — so the 20
`concertable-*` routers add roughly the same again.

**Caveat, stated rather than glossed:** "works on a machine that never cloned the repo" could not be
tested literally, because this machine has the junctions. What was proven junction-independently is that
the payload is self-contained and its internal paths resolve inside the cache; the end-to-end claim is
inferred from that, not observed.

**What remains:** the process cutover (Next Step 1 — the only thing gating #637), the 16 audit defects,
moving Concertable's four remaining hooks, then 5c (discovery — `dotnet/STACK.md` is its first known gap),
3c (markdown outside the conventions folders), 4 (re-check which duplication rows survive — step 1 resolved
the seeding row by deleting `api/agents/SEEDING_CONVENTIONS.md` and cutting `api/AGENTS.md`'s second copy of
the forbidden-table list), and root `AGENTS.md`'s auto-load thinning.

## Done

**Tier 2 split — `tomjseery/react-agents` exists** (`react-agents` `main` `b69b517`, CI green;
`dotagents#1` `1389a2e`, CI green)

- **The nine React docs and their routers left `dotagents`**, with the delivery machinery that makes them
  installable alone: `sync-generated.ps1`, `.agents/plugins/{marketplace,payloads}.json`, the
  `react-standards` plugin and the CI `-Check` job. The generated payload was diffed against the copy
  `dotagents` had produced — INDEX, plugin standards and plugin routers all byte-identical, so the move
  carried no content change. The routers' one authored fact, the doc path, is unchanged; only the repo they
  name moved.
- **`dotagents` is now .NET only**: one plugin, one domain, and a marketplace description that no longer
  claims the TypeScript half. Its README's frontend gap list moved to `react-agents` with the corpus it
  described. `standards/communication/` went too — see below.
- **`deploy-skills.ps1` takes three source roots and three standards roots.** Its duplicate-domain guard
  already covered the collision; nothing else in it changed. Re-running it repointed 18 skill junctions at
  `react-agents` and — unplanned but found by the same run — created the four `~/.agents/standards/`
  domain junctions **for the first time**. Until then every deployed router named a
  `~/.agents/standards/...` path that did not exist on this machine; Phase 6a had deployed the skills and
  not the trees they route to. All 38 deployed routers now resolve to a real file.
- **The generator is a third copy, and the note that said to revisit at the third repo is now due.** The
  `react-agents` copy differs from the `dotagents` one only in its header paragraph. Sharing them needs a
  published module or a submodule, because each repo's CI must self-verify without reaching a private
  sibling; `dotagents/ARCHITECTURE.md` now carries that cost explicitly rather than leaving it in this
  plan, and names a fourth repo as the trigger.

**`standards/communication/` removed from `dotagents`** (`dotagents#1` `a7e9b40`)

- `REVIEW_COMMENTS.md` and `EXPLAINING_CODE.md`, the `draft-comment` and `explaining-code` routers, and the
  `communication-standards` plugin are gone, along with their marketplace and payload entries. They are not
  dotagents' to hold; the "one deliberate exception to this repo being stack-scoped" the plan recorded for
  them is deleted rather than re-argued. `dotagents` is now one plugin, one domain, 20 docs.
- The five junctions the removal orphaned (`draft-comment` and `explaining-code` under both
  `~/.agents/skills` and `~/.claude/skills`, plus `~/.agents/standards/communication`) were deleted as
  reparse points only. `deploy-skills.ps1` leaves orphans in place by design, so it does not do this — 46
  skills and 3 standards domains deployed, nothing dangling.
- **Consequence to be aware of: `~/.claude/skills` no longer carries `draft-comment` or
  `explaining-code`.** Tommy's global `CLAUDE.md` invokes both by name. Nothing in this repo, in
  `agent-standards`, in `react-agents`, or in `infonetica/standards-docs` supplies them today — the
  `infonetica/.claude/skills` set is `attach-pr-screenshots`, `create-devops-item`, `create-gh-pr`,
  `implement`, `ship`, `verify`, `worktree`. Their text is recoverable from `dotagents` history at
  `1389a2e^`.

**Step 1 — `agent-standards` gained its stack sections and the 480 lines came home**
(`agent-standards#2` `b6312f7`; `dotagents` `852e467`; `react-agents` `9cb5ea3`; #637)

- **20 docs, 20 routers, 2 plugins.** `standards/dotnet/` (12 docs across `data/`, `results/`,
  `structure/`, `testing/`) and `standards/react/` (8), mirroring the generic tiers path for path so a
  local doc and its counterpart pair up. `api/agents/` and `app/agents/` are deleted. `api/ARCHITECTURE.md`
  went 242 → 62 lines, keeping only the folder layout the polyrepo cut removes anyway.
- **Blast radius all repointed:** 20 integration-test `AGENTS.md` stubs that `@`-imported
  `INTEGRATION_CONVENTIONS.md`, `api/AGENTS.md`'s three imports and its duplicate copy of the
  forbidden-table list, `app/AGENTS.md`'s two, root `AGENTS.md`, `docs/INDEX.md`, the `review` and
  `e2e-api-debug` skills, three service `ARCHITECTURE.md` files, four `TECH_DEBT.md` files, two tier
  preambles. `skill-routes.json` now pairs every generic route with its local counterpart and gained rows
  for build config, migrations and the tenant feature.
- **Three defects found by executing it, not by reading it:**
  1. The hook was copied into **every** plugin. Fine with one; with three, installing them all registers
     the same `PreToolUse` matcher three times and the router fires three times per write. `payloads.json`
     now names exactly one hook owner, cross-checked against `marketplace.json`.
  2. Pruning never covered `plugins/<p>/hooks`, so the stale copies survived the fix that stopped
     generating them — the same class of bug pruning-by-generated-set-membership was added to prevent.
  3. **`deploy-skills.ps1` junctioned per domain onto one flat `~/.agents/standards/<domain>`.** Correct
     while each domain lived in one repo; wrong the moment a generic domain and its counterpart share a
     name on purpose. Eight paths collide, and it failed **silently**: `concertable-persistence` opened
     dotagents' generic `PERSISTENCE.md` — right path, wrong repo, no error. Standards now deploy at
     `~/.agents/standards/<repo>/<domain>`; skills stay flat because discovery does not recurse, standards
     do not because they are only opened by path. Plugin delivery was never affected — each plugin carries
     its own subtree.
- **Verified rather than assumed:** both new generator guards negative-tested, 37 hook tests pass, 87
  generated files current, 27 plugin routers resolve inside their own plugin, and all **112** deployed
  routers (56 × two harness roots) open a byte-identical copy of their own repo's authored doc.
- **Cost, stated:** 20 more always-on router descriptions, roughly the ~5,242 tokens measured for
  dotagents' 20 again. Forced by the design — the generator refuses a doc with no router.

**Phase 7 — the corpus ships as plugins, and the architecture stops being rediscovered** (same two PRs)

- **A fourth blocking defect, found by building it.** `skill_description` searched only `~/.agents/skills`
  and `~/.claude/skills`. A plugin copies its payload into
  `<harness>/plugins/cache/<marketplace>/<plugin>/<version>/skills/`, so under plugin delivery the router
  would block a write, name the owning skill, and call that correctly-installed standard "a deployment
  fault". Now searches `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` and its own plugin subtree first, then the junction roots, then
  every other installed plugin under both `~/.claude` and `~/.codex`. An uninstall leaves `.orphaned_at`
  behind - one was found on this machine - so orphaned caches are skipped rather than read as available.
  All three resolution tests confirmed to fail without the fix; hook tests 32 → 36.
- **Payloads assigned by domain** from an authored `.agents/plugins/payloads.json`, cross-checked both ways
  against `marketplace.json` - the "explicit skill-to-plugin map" the generator previously refused to
  proceed without. A plugin gets only its own domains, so a TypeScript project installing `react-standards`
  does not also receive the .NET corpus. A domain no plugin ships is an error. All guards negative-tested,
  and all 31 plugin routers verified to resolve to a real doc inside their own plugin.
- **Pruning is by generated-set membership**, not skill name: a doc moving between plugins otherwise leaves
  a stale copy, and a consumer installs two conflicting copies of one rule. Proven by moving a domain and
  moving it back.
- **`dotagents` gained CI** - it had none, so its generated files were only as current as the last local
  run. The check also proves the generator runs on Linux/PowerShell 7 while staying 5.1-compatible.
- **`dotagents/ARCHITECTURE.md`** carries the repo map with its explicit do-not-merge, the
  authoring → generate → install chain (a plugin copies, it does not reference), per-machine setup for both
  harnesses, and what a new project needs. Linked from both READMEs. This plan is deleted when it
  completes, so none of it may live only here.
- **Settled: the 10 utilities ship in no plugin.** They are procedures for working the machine, not
  standards a project consults, and `dotagents` stays a clone-and-junction repo for `~/AGENTS.md` and
  `~/.claude/` regardless. A fifth `personal-utilities` plugin is one map entry away if ever wanted.
- **Generator duplication assessed and consciously kept.** The two scripts are parallel but not identical,
  and `agent-standards` CI must self-verify without reaching a private repo, which rules out one shared copy
  short of a published module. Revisit only if a third repo appears.

**Phase 5 — the doc is the payload, the skill is the router** (`Concertable/agent-standards#2`, CI green;
`tomjseery/dotagents#1`. Neither merged, nothing deployed.)

- **38 skill bodies became docs in a domain tree.** `agent-standards` gained `standards/process/` (7);
  `dotagents` gained `standards/dotnet/` (20, nesting `data/`, `results/`, `structure/`, `testing/`),
  `standards/react/` (9) and `standards/communication/` (2, since removed). Every skill that owns a doc is now eight
  lines: front matter plus that doc's path. Doc names shed what the folder already says
  (`csharp-style` → `dotnet/STYLE.md`) while skill names stay globally unique, because the deployed
  namespace is flat and spans every stack.
- **The repos did NOT merge, and the plan's Phase 5 text saying they would is corrected.** Phase 7's repo
  map is the authority: `dotagents` is personal cross-project machine config, so scoping it to one product
  would break every other codebase that depends on it. The same `standards/<domain>/` convention is applied
  twice instead, with domain names globally unique so both halves land in one deployed namespace.
- **A utility is not a standard.** The 10 machine-tooling skills (`sync`, `worktree`, `recents`, …) are
  procedures the agent runs, not a corpus anyone consults, so their bodies stay in their `SKILL.md` and they
  own no doc. Both generators understand the two kinds.
- **The orphan gate is proven, not nominal.** A router naming a missing doc, a doc with no router, and two
  routers claiming one doc were each negative-tested to confirm they fail. A gate nobody proved fires is the
  same defect class as the `hooks.json` matcher that shipped inert for every Codex write.
- **Generated per-domain `INDEX.md`** replaces `dotagents/README.md`'s hand-maintained topic table — a second
  structure with nothing holding it to the first. `AGENTS.md`'s pointer now names the tree.
- **The plugin gets its own copy of the tree.** An installed plugin is only its own subtree, so plugin
  routers carry a path relative to their own `SKILL.md`. `deploy-skills.ps1` junctions each
  `standards/<domain>` into `~/.agents/standards`, refusing a domain declared by two repos exactly as it
  refuses a duplicate skill name — without that, a deployed router points at a file the session cannot open.
- **Two pre-existing `dotagents` defects fixed:** `draft-comment`'s description carried a colon-space, which
  truncates an unquoted YAML scalar — the repo's own guard existed for it but had never run since the skill
  was added; and `draft-comment` + `explaining-code` had no `.claude/skills` stub at all (41 canonical, 39
  stubs), so both were invisible to a session opened on that repo.
- Path handling deliberately avoids `[Path]::GetRelativePath` and `Resolve-Path -RelativeBasePath` (both
  PowerShell 7 only): these repos are cloned onto 5.1 machines, while CI runs the same script on Linux.

**Phase 6 tier 3 — the stub states the tier, the gate makes it unskippable, and the review reads the
same table** (`agent-standards` `262564f`, this PR)

- **The route table now answers after the fact, not only at write time.** `skill_router.py --skills-for
  <paths>` (paths as args or on stdin, `--json` for a caller) resolves changed files through the same
  matcher the hook blocks with, prints the skills those files oblige a reader to load, and reports any
  deny pattern already sitting in the tree. Path/content matching and the deny scan moved into shared
  functions, so a review can never resolve a path differently from the block that fired on it. Authored
  in `agent-standards` and re-vendored here (hash check green); its tests there went 13 → 20.
- **`review` Step 2 runs it.** The hand-maintained list of 24 skill names is gone — a list in a review
  skill is the same discretion the incident exposed, one indirection later. `incremental-review` and
  `big-review` inherit it. A `DENY PATTERN HIT` line is stated to be a confirmed finding, not a hint.
  **The table is narrower than that list was**, so four rows were added where a miss is expensive and
  silent — `*Seeder.cs` → `seeding`, `*Validator(s).cs` → `validation`, `*Module.cs` → `module-structure`,
  `*AppHost*/Program.cs` → `microservice-boundaries` (28/29/20/6 files) — and Step 2 states the table is
  the floor, not the ceiling: a skill you had to *remember* is a missing row, not a paragraph to re-add.
- **Every test project now states its tier at the point of use, and `docs_reachability.py` requires it.**
  17 test projects had no `AGENTS.md` at all — including `Concertable.B2B.ArchitectureTests`, both Auth
  suites, Payment's integration suite and five `Concertable.Shared` unit suites — which is the hole that
  made the `@`-import argument moot in the incident: there was nowhere for a pointer to live at the moment
  the tier was being chosen. All 17 pairs created; the gate errors on any `IsTestProject == true`
  directory without one (the existing sibling rule supplies the `CLAUDE.md` half, so it is stated once).
- **Every unit and integration stub now leads with the decision, not the pointer** — "a test that needs a
  host, HTTP, a container or a database belongs in `*.IntegrationTests`", and its converse. The four
  `*.IntegrationTests.Fixtures` stubs got the honest version instead: a support library declaring
  `<IsTestProject>false</IsTestProject>`, which the earlier sweep had wrongly labelled a suite.
- Verified: hook suite **91 passed** (was 88), `agent-standards` **20 passed**, `sync-generated -Check`
  and `vendor-hooks -Check` clean, `docs_reachability.py` **0 errors / 23 warnings** (all `plans/`).
- **Gap found, not closed here:** no Concertable workflow runs the Python hook tests, so the vendored-hook
  drift test and the route-table test only run when someone runs them locally. Adding a workflow would put
  `.github/workflows/**` in the diff, which the merge gate treats as security-sensitive and would re-stale
  #637's markers — so it is a follow-up, listed below rather than smuggled in.

**Phase 6b — one authored hook, two delivery routes, both harnesses wired** (`agent-standards` `df35cea`,
this PR)

Tommy's ruling when the install question surfaced: the plugin stays the single author, and each consuming
repo carries a generated, drift-checked copy plus its own wiring — because a plugin only runs where it was
installed, and enforcement absent on a fresh clone is not enforcement.

- **`agent-standards` restructured.** `.agents/hooks/skill_router.py` (+ 13 mechanism tests over a fixture
  route table, so a route added downstream can't change what the mechanism is asserted to do),
  `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` as the canonical manifest, `plugins/agent-process/hooks/hooks.json`,
  and `.agents/sync-generated.ps1` replacing the stub script — it now emits the repo-local stubs, the
  plugin payload, the hook copy and the `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` shim, with a `-Check` mode. The
  repo ships code now, so it got CI (pytest + staleness check) and a `.gitignore`.
- **A latent defect fixed in passing:** the plugin's skill files were stubs pointing at
  `../../../../.agents/skills/…`, and a harness installs only the plugin subtree — so the plugin would
  have installed cleanly and delivered nothing, on every machine. Payload now carries full copies.
- **Concertable keeps the router, as a generated copy.** `.agents/vendor-hooks.ps1 -Into <repo>` wrote it
  plus `.agents/hooks/vendored.json` (source, commit, sha256); `test_vendored_hooks.py` fails if the copy
  is edited in place or wired for only one harness. `.agents/README.md` now separates repo-owned hooks
  from vendored ones, and `docs/INDEX.md` gained the three missing enforcement rows (build tier gate,
  skill router, vendored-hook check).
- **The real Claude-only defect closed:** `.codex/hooks.json` now carries the router alongside its Stop
  hook, using the same `command`/`commandWindows` pair. Codex reads project hooks from
  `<repo>/.codex/hooks.json` and trusts them **by hash per hook per path** — verified from
  `~/.codex/config.toml`'s `[hooks.state.'…:stop:0:0']` entry — so the new PreToolUse entry needs a
  one-time approval in Codex, and each worktree is trusted separately from the main checkout.
- Hook suite **88 passed** (was 84); `agent-standards` **13 passed**, generator `-Check` and
  `vendor-hooks -Check` both clean.
- **Found while probing, not yet fixed (Phase 6a's problem, not this PR's):** a Codex session logs
  `failed to load skill ~/.agents/skills/sync/SKILL.md: missing YAML frontmatter` and the same for
  `worktree` — two installed skills are dead in every Codex session — and Codex warns that skill
  descriptions were shortened to fit its skills budget.

**`origin/main` merge — three doc conflicts, resolved keeping both sides' intent** (this PR)

- `api/Concertable.Payment/ARCHITECTURE.md` — kept the `keyed-strategies` skill pointer *and* main's new
  `PROVIDER_CONTRACT.md` line.
- `api/TECH_DEBT.md` — took main's sharper `extension()` resolves-when (whole-container migration,
  `XExtensions`/`XMappers` grouping, generator declarations excluded) with the citation repointed from the
  deleted `agents/CODE_CONVENTIONS.md` section to the `csharp-style` skill.
- `api/agents/CODE_CONVENTIONS.md` — kept the reduced file, but main had added a rule the cut never saw:
  **integration events version the wire identity, not the CLR type**
  (`concertable.payment.payment-operation-state-changed.v1`, verified against `[MessageType]` in code).
  No skill owns event wire versioning, so deleting it would have dropped a live rule; kept in repo and
  listed under promotion candidates. `docs/INDEX.md` updated to name the new topic.
- Main's other two edits to that file needed no repo home: the `EscrowMappers` example moving to
  `extension()` blocks, and the strengthened extension-members section — both generic, both now
  promotion candidates against `csharp-style`/`csharp-naming`.

**Phase 3b — the in-repo corpus reduced to its roster** (this PR)

- `api/agents/*` **1,986 → 349** lines, `app/agents/*` **752 → 118**. Each surviving file opens by naming the
  skills that own its generic half, then carries only what those skills deliberately omit.
- **Four files deleted, their local remnants rehomed.** `UNIT_CONVENTIONS.md` (fully owned by `unit-testing`,
  which also settles its open Shouldly question with "one assertion library per tier");
  `DEBUGGING_CONVENTIONS.md` (owned by `logging`, and its separate existence was what let it contradict
  `CA1848`); `E2E_CONVENTIONS.md` → the local eight lines now sit in
  `Concertable.Shared/tests/Concertable.Testing.E2E/AGENTS.md`, beside the baseline file they name;
  `MICROSERVICE_COMMUNICATION.md` → the per-service surface table folded into `api/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- **`CONVENTIONS.md` → `MODULE_STRUCTURE.md`**, killing the collision with `CODE_CONVENTIONS.md`, and its
  "modules in the monolith" framing replaced with "each service is a modular monolith *internally*".
- **B2B's scoped topics left the api-wide floor.** Context stances, the filtered/unfiltered entity list, the
  `DealType` strategy families and the workflow steps now live in `api/Concertable.B2B/CODE_PATTERNS.md`,
  imported only by `api/Concertable.B2B/AGENTS.md` — so Customer, Search, Payment and Auth stop paying ~150
  lines they can never act on. B2B's active-tenant *naming* rules joined the active-tenant section already in
  its `AGENTS.md`, which is the same concern.
- **23 stubs repointed:** 17 unit-test and 6 E2E project `AGENTS.md` files now name their skill in one line
  instead of `@`-importing a file. The 12 integration stubs still import `INTEGRATION_CONVENTIONS.md`, which
  survives as the fixture/harness inventory.
- **`docs/INDEX.md` re-pointed** at the owning skill per topic, with a stated two-kinds-of-owner rule (a skill
  owns the rule, an in-repo file owns the inventory) and rule 7 rewritten around what *pulls a rule in* rather
  than the old 42-stub example that no longer exists.
- **~30 inbound references corrected** across service `ARCHITECTURE.md`s, four `TECH_DEBT.md`s, `docs/OVERVIEW.md`,
  `api/docs/MICROSERVICES_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `app/mobile/shared/AGENTS.md`, and the `review`, `e2e-ui-debug` and
  `e2e-api-debug` skills — each now pointing at whichever skill or file actually holds the rule.
- **Two live defects found by checking code before writing the rule down**, both inherited from the old docs:
  the B2B identity module is `@b2b/*`'s `features/tenant`, not the `features/identity` both docs claimed, and
  `B2bIdentity` *extends* `User` rather than wrapping it in the `{ user, memberships }` shape the old code
  sample showed. Also fixed: `e2e-ui-debug` and `e2e-api-debug` still told you to leave a one-off probe as an
  inline `logger.Log*` call, which `CA1848 = error` rejects at build — the same contradiction Phase 2 fixed in
  the doc but not in the two skills that read it first.
- **One rule deliberately kept in repo rather than cut:** "one repository per entity", which landed on `main`
  mid-phase and no skill owns. Deleting it would have removed a live rule on the strength of a skill that does
  not cover it.
- Verified: `docs_reachability.py` reports **0 errors** (21 warnings, all pre-existing `plans/` working docs);
  hook suite green at 72. Every type name written into the new B2B and app rosters was checked against code.

**Phase 3a — the corpus moved out as `.agents`-canonical skills** (`agent-standards` `ffe5721`,
`dotagents` `00e02f9`)

- 36 skills, split by whether the rule names this product: 29 generic in `dotagents` → `~/.agents/skills/`
  (C# style/naming, comments, DI, logging, validation, the three Result skills, persistence, multitenancy,
  keyed strategies, module structure, service boundaries, proto, HTTP contracts, seeding, the three test tiers,
  and the 9 TypeScript/React ones — 29 by a later enumeration of `dotagents/.agents/skills`, which the
  original 28/8 counts undercounted); 7 Concertable-shaped process ones in the org repo.
- **`.agents/skills/` is canonical in both**, with `.claude/skills/` and `plugins/*/skills/` as generated
  stubs from one generator — nothing is Claude-only, and Codex reads the same files.
- The stub generator mirrors each canonical `description` and fails rather than emit an unroutable stub. That
  guard caught a live defect: a bare colon-space truncates an unquoted YAML scalar, so `module-structure` and
  `typescript-style` had no description to route on and would never have loaded, with nothing visibly wrong.
- Two topics deliberately not migrated — "questions come before actions" and "act on reversible work" are
  always-applicable rules whose violation is silent, so a load-on-demand skill is the wrong tier. They stay
  global, as does the comment *policy*; only the C# mechanics became a skill.

**Phase 2 — correctness** (`e5df43bd4`)

- Ten contradictions between loaded docs reconciled, six settled by code or config rather than opinion.
- Root-relative `./e2e.ps1` / `./docker-health.ps1` corrected in root `AGENTS.md` (4) and the four e2e skills (39).
- `Notification` no longer documented as an adapter service a data service may `WaitFor` — only
  `Concertable.Shared.Notification`, a library, exists.
- Deleted `MM_NORTH_STAR.md` (423) and `MICROSERVICES_NORTH_STAR.md` (83); twelve dangling references fixed;
  five rotted citations stripped from `app/agents/CODE_PATTERNS.md`.

**Phase 1 — index, meta-rules, and the machine check**

- `docs/INDEX.md`; `docs_reachability.py` extended to error on a guidance doc linking a non-existent file or
  using a root-absolute path. Six tests added; suite green at 72.

## Reviews

`/review` run against #637 over `9205e82d..2b93b45b` → `reviews/Docs-GuidanceDocsRestructure.md`, security
layer included (the range touches `api/Concertable.Payment/**`, which the merge gate treats as sensitive;
those 12 lines are pointer rewiring, nothing to report). **10 findings, all fixed on the branch.** Four of
them were the corpus asserting something the code does not do, found by checking the code rather than the
prose:

- The rename to `MODULE_STRUCTURE.md` left five citations of the deleted `CONVENTIONS.md` — including a
  NetArchTest `.Because(...)` string, so a failing boundary test pointed the developer at a missing file.
- `api/ARCHITECTURE.md`'s new surface table gave B2B, Customer and Search a gRPC internal surface. Payment
  is the only one: one `.proto`, `AddGrpc`/`MapGrpcService` only in `Payment.Web`. The table came from the
  deleted `MICROSERVICE_COMMUNICATION.md`, where it was target-state — folding it into the doc `INDEX.md`
  calls "current-state, authoritative" turned a plan into a claim. Now marked target-vs-live per row.
- `INTEGRATION_CONVENTIONS.md` told tests to read `fixture.Catalog`, which no integration fixture exposes
  (`fixture.SeedState` / `fixture.SeedNow` are real; `Catalog` is on Customer's *E2E* `AppFixture`).
- `app/agents/CODE_CONVENTIONS.md` rostered a `$type` union named `Contract`, which does not exist in
  `app/` at all — the real second union is `Deal`, and a third is the search `Header` pair.

Also fixed: B2B's stance table put every concrete `DbContext` in `B2B.DataAccess.Infrastructure` (only the
bases are there); `INTEGRATION_CONVENTIONS.md` kept two `seeding`-skill rules under a
"Concertable-specific" heading; `api/AGENTS.md`'s inlined seed list still omitted invitation rows (the
drift the plan's table recorded); `E2E_UI_CONVENTIONS.md` + `E2E_CONSIDERATIONS.md` had zero inbound links
repo-wide and the hook can't see them (its orphan walk covers `*/agents/*.md` only) — now linked from the
harness `AGENTS.md` and `docs/INDEX.md`; `docs/INDEX.md` gave one topic two owners; `e2e-api-debug`
cited `api/docs/SEEDING_CONVENTIONS.md`.

Re-verified after the fixes: hooks **72 passed**, `docs_reachability.py` **0 errors / 21 warnings**.

Both markers have since moved forward twice more with nothing re-reviewable in between — the two
base-currency merges of `origin/main`, whose only content outside `reviews/` is the platform pin bump
already reviewed and merged on `main` as #645. Review state on that range: **clean, 0 open findings.**

**That review has now run** (`c8302694..e29cd957`, 21 commits, 101 files). Note the range: the marker
already sat at `c8302694`, not the `2b93b45b` this ledger previously named — the marker is the contract
between runs, and the two moves after `2b93b45b` were over merges already reviewed on `main`. **Three
findings, all fixed on the branch**, so the markers are stamped at the fix head rather than `e29cd957`:

- **ENF1 (HIGH)** — the router's Codex leg was inert. `.codex/hooks.json` matched `apply_patch`, but the
  router only knew Claude's PascalCase names and its `file_path` key, so every Codex write exited 0. The
  drift test could not see it: it asserts the hook's *filename* appears in both wiring files, which was
  true throughout. Fixed upstream (`agent-standards` `268796e`, payload `88cf091`) and re-vendored;
  `test_every_wired_tool_name_is_one_the_hook_acts_on` now makes the matcher and the hook's own
  vocabulary agree. **This retires Next Step 2's premise** — approving the old hook in Codex would have
  approved an inert one.
- **ENF2 (MEDIUM)** — the unit-tier source list covered 2 of the 6 host families the PackageReference
  check names, so a unit project reaching Respawn/Playwright/Testcontainers/Aspire *transitively* (the
  live shape: `Concertable.Payment.E2ETests.Helpers.UnitTests` → `…E2ETests.Helpers`) passed both gates.
  Six fingerprints added and proved end-to-end with a build probe.
- **ENF3 (LOW)** — 53 lines of one comment pasted at nine import sites, self-contradictory in
  `api/Directory.Build.targets`. Deleted.

**The doc-truth probe that ran alongside those three is now closed too** (`4bbb2ddb0`). It carried four
open items into Next Step 5; checking each against code rather than the prose split them evenly. Two were
real — `CODE_PATTERNS.md`'s repository counts (Concert 6/6 and Conversations 2/2 against an actual 9/13
and 3/4) and its Refit inventory missing `ICustomerUserClaimsApi` — and are fixed. Two were correct as
written and needed only the extraction nobody had done: the `TenantPermission` ↔ `SharedPermissions`
mirror diffs identical at 13, and `customerClient` is where the doc says. The counts finding also killed a
precedent rather than a number — the doc cited Conversations as proof of a rule `MessageRepository`
breaks.

## Topology — four tiers, settled 2026-08-18

**Authoritative statement: `dotagents/AGENTS.md` (mirrors to `~/AGENTS.md`, so it loads every session) and
`dotagents/ARCHITECTURE.md`. The plan's "target structure — four tiers" section is the file-by-file version.
This ledger does not restate the model — it records only what is not yet true of it. As of 2026-08-19 the
file trees match it; what is left is the process corpus still living in two places (Next Step 1).**

| Tier | Repo | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Generic .NET | `tomjseery/dotagents` | 20 docs in `standards/dotnet/` — correct |
| Generic React/TS | `tomjseery/react-agents` | created 2026-08-18 — 9 docs in `standards/react/`, moved out of `dotagents` |
| Concertable | `Concertable/agent-standards` | all three sections built 2026-08-19 — `process/` 7, `dotnet/` 12, `react/` 8. `api/agents/` and `app/agents/` are deleted |
| One microservice | that service's own repo | 67 backend + 8 app `AGENTS.md` in place, and each may name sibling docs (`CODE_CONVENTIONS.md`) where a module has conventions of its own |

`dot` in `dotagents` is **dotNET**, not dotfiles. `agent-standards` gets no `platform/` or `concertable/`
folder — Concertable *is* the platform and the repo boundary already carries that scope.

**Three models were recorded as settled before this one, each wrong, and each rebuilt confidently by a later
session from what its predecessor wrote down:** one merged `standards` repo holding generic and product rules
together; then `dotagents` holding both stacks; then a `platform/` folder inside the Concertable repo. All
three are purged from the plan and this ledger. The misreading of `dot` as "dotfiles" is what produced the
second.

`agent-utilities` keeps the machine tooling (`sync`, `worktree`, `recents`, `search`, `unmerged`, …), which is
neither a standard nor stack-specific. `agent-starter-kit` is archived — a strict subset of `dotagents`, two
of its skills carrying a BOM that breaks frontmatter parsing.

**A service repo carries no skills at all (Phase 7).** Not `.claude/skills/` stubs, not `.agents/skills/`,
not a vendored hook. Skills arrive as plugins installed once per machine at user scope; a repo keeps only its
`AGENTS.md` roster, its `skill-routes.json`, and the two per-harness wiring files.


## Next Steps

**The four tiers now match the model.** Authoritative statement: `dotagents/AGENTS.md` (mirrors to
`~/AGENTS.md`, so it loads every session) and `dotagents/ARCHITECTURE.md`; the file-by-file target is the
plan's "target structure — four tiers" section. Three superseded models were purged — do not reintroduce a
merged standards repo, `dotagents` holding both stacks, or a `platform/`/`concertable/` folder.

**Repo heads at handoff, all pushed and CI green:** `dotagents` `852e467` (#1), `react-agents` `9cb5ea3`
(`main`), `agent-standards` `b6312f7` (#2), Concertable `72b692246` (#637, 55 pass / 5 skip). Nothing is
merged; #637 is the working branch and is **not** for merge (see the gate below).

**Deployed layout on this machine:** `~/.agents/standards/<repo>/<domain>/` — repo-scoped, because a
generic domain and its Concertable counterpart share a relative path on purpose. Skills stay flat in
`~/.agents/skills` and `~/.claude/skills` (66 of them). `deploy-skills.ps1` in `dotagents` owns both.

Audit findings: `reviews/Docs-GuidanceDocsRestructure-AuditFindings.md` (16 defects).

**Still open from step 1, deliberately:** `results/ERRORS.md`, `testing/UNIT.md` and `testing/E2E.md` are
named gaps — nothing in the 480 lines was error-inventory or unit/E2E content, so 5c fills them or deletes
the rows. `react/APP_TIERS.md` and `react/BROWSER_STORAGE.md` are named in the plan's Tier 3 block but
their sources sit outside the 480 lines, so they stay with the rest of 3c.

1. **Cut the process corpus over — P0 in the findings, and the only thing gating #637.**
   `standards/process/` was **copied, not moved**. Measured 2026-08-19: the seven extracted docs are 463
   lines in `agent-standards`, while the Concertable originals still sit at full length —

   | Concertable original | Lines | Extracted counterpart |
   |---|---|---|
   | `AGENTS.md` | 298 | `BRANCHING`, `COMMITTING`, `MERGING`, `DOCS_AND_DEBT`, `FAILING_TESTS` |
   | `plans/AGENTS.md` | 168 | `PLANS`, `COMMITTING`, `REMOTE_VALIDATION` |
   | `plans/agents/PLAN.md` | 328 | `PLANS` |
   | `plans/agents/ROADMAP.md` | 51 | `PLANS` |
   | `docs/REMOTE_VALIDATION.md` | 57 | `REMOTE_VALIDATION` |
   | `PROMPTS.md` | 67 | `PLANS` |

   — and **`grep` for each of the seven skill names across every Concertable `*.md` returns zero files**, so
   nothing routes to them. `MERGING.md` duplicates root `AGENTS.md`'s poll loop near-byte-for-byte.

   Slim each original to Concertable-only procedure (real labels, workflows, commands, script paths) and
   point at the owning skill, exactly as the stack halves now do. Phase 3c's already-settled ruling applies:
   **the executable in-repo `merge` skill owns the procedure**, root `AGENTS.md` keeps only the invariants
   whose violation is silent and expensive, one line each, and the generic `merging` standard drops the loop
   body. Add the seven to `.agents/skill-routes.json` where a path implies one.

2. **Fix the 16 audit defects**, P0 correctness first: the `[LoggerMessage]` carve-out (the corpus currently
   bans its own canonical example), the `XMappers` examples that demonstrate a banned form, and
   `PERSISTENCE.md`'s impossible repository signature. Then the paraphrase-losses — `axios`,
   `Reqnroll`/`Playwright`, `Aspire` and its four extension methods, `Docker`/`pre-login handshake`,
   `Monitor`, the `NAMING.md` precedent column, `[Collection]`/`InitializeAsync`,
   `Environments`/`IHostEnvironment`, the raw-hook litmus members, the TanStack API names, `silenceErrors`,
   the retry cap, `grep -rniE`.

3. **Move Concertable's four remaining hooks to `agent-standards`** — `plan_handoff_stop.py` + launcher,
   `plan_graph.py`, `docs_reachability.py`, `merge-review-gate.py`. They enforce standards that already
   moved, so enforcement sits apart from its rule with nothing watching for drift. **Verify a plugin `Stop`
   hook fires with zero repo wiring first** — that was proven only for `PreToolUse`.

4. **Then the remaining phases**: 5c (the discovery pass — conventions that exist only in code, e.g. B2B's
   stance taxonomy), 3c (markdown outside the conventions folders), 4 (the last duplication rows), and the
   deferred auto-load thinning of root `AGENTS.md`.

**#637's tiering blocker is cleared.** All four tiers now match the model, the corpus it points at is the
one the model describes, and the install was proven in both harnesses. What remains before merge is
**step 1** — `standards/process/` was copied rather than moved, so the Concertable originals still sit at
full length and nothing references the extracted docs. Merging with that outstanding ships two live copies
of the process rules.

**Tommy's, not agent work:**

- **`draft-comment` and `explaining-code` are deployed nowhere.** Their docs were removed from `dotagents`
  on 2026-08-19 as not that repo's to hold (`dotagents` `a7e9b40`; text recoverable at `1389a2e^`). His
  global `CLAUDE.md` invokes both by name. Checked and not found in `infonetica/.claude/skills`
  (`attach-pr-screenshots`, `create-devops-item`, `create-gh-pr`, `implement`, `ship`, `verify`,
  `worktree`) or `infonetica/standards-docs` — but that is two directories, not a sweep, so this is "not
  wired up", not "does not exist". **Needs Tommy to say which repo owns them.**
- Approve the Codex `PreToolUse` hook once in a Codex session in this worktree.
- Archive `agent-starter-kit`.
- Rule on `GenreController` in a shared library (`api/Concertable.Shared/TECH_DEBT.md:70`).
- Decide whether React Hook Form is adopted (in no `app/` workspace today).
- Settle the Shouldly-for-unit-tests open call recorded in `dotnet/testing/UNIT.md`.

**Operational note for whoever picks this up:** the Bash tool truncates a long command, and a heredoc that
gets cut mid-body fails as `unexpected EOF while looking for matching quote` rather than as a length error.
Two doc-writing batches died that way. Write the file with the Write tool, or put a generator in a `.py`
file and run that — do not push long content through a heredoc.


## Also Tommy's, not blocking

`tomjseery/agent-starter-kit` (public, 7 skills) looks redundant with `tomjseery/dotagents` (private, the
same 7 plus `pull-main`, `sync-all`, `unmerged`) — the same duplication disease at repo level.
