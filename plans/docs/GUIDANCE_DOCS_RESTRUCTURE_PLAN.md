# Guidance-docs restructure — plan

Reorganize the guidance corpus (root `AGENTS.md`, `api/agents/*`, `app/agents/*`, `docs/*`,
`api/docs/*`) so that every rule has exactly one home, the auto-loaded weight is proportionate, and the
generic half lives in a separate repo, mounted at a fixed path, so carving a service out of this
monorepo rewrites no imports.

All line references verified against `origin/main` at `dc037f477`.

Non-goal here: the extraction itself, and the analyzer push-down. Both are follow-up PRs.

## What is already solved — do not re-propose it

`origin/main` fixed the discovery problem while this analysis was being written:

- `app/AGENTS.md` and `app/mobile/AGENTS.md` now exist; root `AGENTS.md:46–62` is a real per-area index.
- Root `AGENTS.md:50` states a reachability rule — every `AGENTS.md` needs a `CLAUDE.md` sibling
  containing exactly `@AGENTS.md`, and every `*/agents/*.md` must be transitively reachable from some
  `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`/`SKILL.md`. **Mechanically enforced** by `.agents/hooks/docs_reachability.py`,
  run as part of `docs-review`. It currently reports 0 errors.

So the corpus is now *loaded*. It is not *organized*, and nothing checks that it is.

## The gap: three properties, only one of them automated

`docs_reachability.py` (135 lines) does exactly two things — verifies the `CLAUDE.md` sibling
(`:68–83`) and BFS-reachability of `agents/*.md` (`:100–109`). What it does **not** do, verified by
reading it:

- **It never tests that a link target exists.** `resolve_reference` (`:47`) strips anchors and skips
  `http`/`mailto`; the only `is_file()` call in the file (`:72`) is the `CLAUDE.md` sibling check. A link
  to a deleted file still counts as an edge and still marks the target "reachable".
- **Its orphan check is scoped to `agents/*.md` only** (`:31–37`), one level deep. `docs/**`,
  `api/docs/**`, `plans/**`, `README*`, `PROMPTS.md` are outside its search space entirely — which is
  why it is green while five docs are unreachable.
- **Root-absolute links create bogus edges.** `/api/docs/MM_NORTH_STAR.md` resolves against drive-root,
  not repo-root. `api/agents/CONVENTIONS.md:3` and `:106` use exactly that form.

And the only review that could catch duplication is scoped out of it: `docs-review` Lens B/C are prose
lenses over a **diff**, and Step 4 explicitly instructs *"Discard: pre-existing issues on unchanged
lines"* (`.agents/skills/docs-review/SKILL.md:139–140`). A contradiction that already exists on
unchanged lines is structurally invisible to the process meant to find it.

**Reachable ≠ correct ≠ non-duplicated.** One is automated; the other two are not checked by anything.

## Ten live contradictions

Each verified against current file contents.

| # | Conflict | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `api/agents/DEBUGGING_CONVENTIONS.md:5` — "leave it as an inline `logger.Log*` call" vs `CODE_CONVENTIONS.md:396` "**No** inline `logger.LogInformation/…`" and `api/AGENTS.md:3` "**never**" | **Settled by evidence.** `.editorconfig:17` sets `CA1848` to error for all `[*.cs]`, exempt only under Migrations; grep finds **0** inline calls across `api/**`. The debugging doc instructs code that does not compile — and it is the doc `e2e-ui-debug:222` / `e2e-api-debug:194` tell you to read first |
| 2 | Root `AGENTS.md:227`, `:241`×2, `:244` cite `./e2e.ps1` / `./docker-health.ps1` vs `E2E_CONVENTIONS.md:29`, `:36` citing `./scripts/e2e.ps1` | **Settled.** Neither exists at root; only `scripts/` does, and `scripts/e2e.ps1` prints `./scripts/e2e.ps1` in its own usage. 4 wrong lines in the always-loaded file, plus ~32 in the four e2e skills, against 5 correct |
| 3 | Root `AGENTS.md:125–127` "exactly ONE of **three** terminal states" vs `:129` "The **four** outcomes:" with four items listed and exits 0/2/3/4 | **Settled** — the preamble wasn't updated when the DIRTY state was inserted |
| 4 | `Monitor`: root `AGENTS.md:123` (heading) + `:157` "**Never use the `Monitor` tool**" vs `merge/SKILL.md:111` "**Prefer the `Monitor` tool**" and `:229` "prefer the `Monitor` tool over busy-waiting" | **Resolved:** rule stays in root — always loaded, and it carries the rationale — and `merge` now defers to it. Moving it into the skill would have traded correctness for token savings |
| 5 | Branch currency: root `AGENTS.md:102–107` "**Update first, then enable — always**… mandatory" and `merge:100–108` "non-negotiable" vs `pr-preflight:25–27` "still mergeable (the queue rebases it)" and `:63–68` "soft… not fatal" | **Resolved: mandatory.** `pr-preflight` is now a hard gate. The cost is asymmetric — being wrong means merging code never built against current `main`, with a possibly stale platform pin |
| 6 | Notification is an adapter **service** (`api/ARCHITECTURE.md:34`, `api/AGENTS.md:11`, `MICROSERVICES_NORTH_STAR.md:22`, `:50`) vs a shared **library** (`MICROSERVICES_ARCHITECTURE.md:186–206`, decided 2026-05-19) | **Settled by code.** There is no Notification service or host — only `api/Concertable.Shared/src/Concertable.Shared.Notification`, a library. Nothing can `WaitFor` it. Both auto-loaded docs are wrong |
| 7 | `MICROSERVICES_ARCHITECTURE.md:246` lists "gRPC between services" under **Disallowed**, repeated `:461`, `:492` vs `api/ARCHITECTURE.md:35` "may call them synchronously (gRPC)", `api/AGENTS.md:24` (B2B fronts Payment over gRPC), and `Concertable.Grpc` existing | **Settled by code** — the design record is stale |
| 8 | `CODE_CONVENTIONS.md:292–297` "do **not** add Result-pattern rules here" vs `:299–328`, a Result-payload naming rule duplicating `RESULT_PATTERN.md:574–585` | **Settled** — self-contradiction two lines apart |
| 9 | `api/AGENTS.md:69–73` mandates `XDetailsResponse` "even when it is currently a field-for-field clone" vs `CODE_CONVENTIONS.md:301` / `RESULT_PATTERN.md:581` gating `Response` on the wire "genuinely differ[ing]" | **Resolved:** `RESULT_PATTERN` now points at `CODE_CONVENTIONS` for DTO naming, which points at `api/AGENTS.md` where the carve-out lives. One home, one path to the exception |
| 10 | `app/web/AGENTS.md:26` "never import `AxiosError`/`isAxiosError`" vs `app/agents/CODE_CONVENTIONS.md:206` and `CODE_PATTERNS.md:191`, which allow `isAxiosError(e) && status === 401` in a route guard | **Resolved by code, opposite to the first guess:** guards use `isApiError` from the shared seam and `isAxiosError` appears only in the shared client/interceptor, so `app/web/AGENTS.md` was right and both `app/agents` docs were stale |

Plus a looser-predecessor pair that isn't opposing but is exploitable: `CODE_CONVENTIONS.md:192–194`
("Only add a comment when the WHY is non-obvious" — no ≤2-line cap, no disqualifiers) sits directly
above `:196–200`, which correctly delegates to root. An agent can cite `:192` to justify a comment root
policy bans.

## Duplication with drift

The full tables are in the analysis; these are the ones that matter.

| Rule | Copies | State |
|---|---|---|
| Never seed handler-written rows | `api/AGENTS.md:26–45`, `SEEDING_CONVENTIONS.md:3–11` + `:45–57`, `api/ARCHITECTURE.md:63`, `INTEGRATION_CONVENTIONS.md:71`, `E2E_CONVENTIONS.md:17` | **Drifting.** `api/AGENTS.md:28` says "Not the summary below — the full file. Every time." then gives a 17-line summary. `SEEDING_CONVENTIONS.md:54–55` has invitation rows/memberships that `api/AGENTS.md` lacks |
| Migrations | `api/AGENTS.md:47–56`, `api/agents/CONVENTIONS.md:139–142` | **Drift.** "every **module's**" vs "every **context's**"; the CONVENTIONS copy drops the load-bearing "never a cost to weigh" clause and ends with a pathless "See CLAUDE.md" |
| DTO / `Response` naming | `api/AGENTS.md:58–87`, `CODE_CONVENTIONS.md:299–328`, `RESULT_PATTERN.md:574–585` | 3 copies, 2 drift — see contradictions 8 and 9 |
| Payment owns no seed catalog | `api/AGENTS.md:14`, `api/ARCHITECTURE.md:49–53` + `:88–103`, `SEEDING_CONVENTIONS.md:36` + `:71–81` | Agree, 4 copies |
| Docker health pre-flight | root `AGENTS.md:213–244` + 4 e2e skills | Agree, **5 near-verbatim copies**, all with the wrong path. `integration-debug:58` states a *weaker* floor with no data-round-trip gate |
| Plan handoff pointer | `PROMPTS.md:3–13`, `plans/AGENTS.md:88–104`, `plans/agents/PLAN.md:287–309`, root `AGENTS.md:277–283`, + `plan_handoff_stop.py` | 4 prose copies + a hook. `plans/AGENTS.md:88–100` paraphrases `PROMPTS.md:3–13` *and* links it |
| Branch prefix | root `AGENTS.md:85` allows `Feature/`,`Refactor/`,`Bug/`,`Fix/` vs `plans/AGENTS.md:124` hardcodes `Feature/<Name>`; `commit/SKILL.md:43` adds "unless the user explicitly says otherwise" to root's absolute rule | Narrowing drift both ways |
| App-side near-verbatim double-writes | `app/agents/CODE_CONVENTIONS.md:194`/`CODE_PATTERNS.md:177` (error seam), `:360`/`:303` (zod boundary), `:217`/`:264` (`xApi`), `:237`/`:274` (axios), `:285`/`:216` (hook tiers) | 5 sections written twice — **and both files are `@`-imported**, so each rule enters context twice |

The app-side axios copy is not merely redundant, it is wrong: `app/agents/CODE_PATTERNS.md:276` cites
`web/shared/lib/axios.tsx` and `b2b/shared/lib/b2bAxios.ts`; neither exists. The real files are
`app/shared/src/lib/apiClient.ts`, `paymentClient.ts`, `searchClient.ts` and
`app/web/b2b/shared/src/lib/b2bClient.ts` — exactly as `CODE_CONVENTIONS.md:249` says. Both versions
load every prompt.

## Auto-loaded weight

`@`-import is the only auto-load mechanism.

| Scope | Lines |
|---|---|
| Always (repo root) | **302** — `CLAUDE.md` 1 + `AGENTS.md` 300 |
| On touching any `api/**` file | **+1,429** — `api/CLAUDE.md` 1 + `api/AGENTS.md` 97 + `CODE_CONVENTIONS.md` 418 + `RESULT_PATTERN.md` 620 + `CODE_PATTERNS.md` 293 |
| On touching `app/**` | **+786** — `app/AGENTS.md` 34 + `CODE_CONVENTIONS.md` 389 + `CODE_PATTERNS.md` 363 |
| Peak, inside an integration-test project | **~1,881** |
| Plain-linked pool, loaded only on explicit read | **560** — `api/ARCHITECTURE.md` 219, `CONVENTIONS.md` 142, `SEEDING_CONVENTIONS.md` 113, `MICROSERVICE_COMMUNICATION.md` 81, `DEBUGGING_CONVENTIONS.md` 5 |

Two things fall out of this table:

- `RESULT_PATTERN.md` alone (620) is more than double the always-loaded root file, and every `api/**`
  prompt pays for it — including its package pins, gRPC transport rules and CI-carve requirements.
- **`SEEDING_CONVENTIONS.md` is not auto-loaded — which is precisely why `api/AGENTS.md:26–45`
  re-summarizes it inline.** The duplication is a symptom of the load mechanism, not carelessness. The
  fix is to choose: import it, or cut the summary to a pointer. Not both.

The app side shows the same trade made the other way: orphan-ness was fixed by `@`-importing 752 lines
that contain 5 duplicated sections. Reachability was bought with weight rather than with dedupe.

## Prose that re-argues what a machine already enforces

| Rule | Prose | Enforcer |
|---|---|---|
| `CODE_PATTERNS.md:7` tenancy composition | 61 lines | `RS0030` = error (`.editorconfig:20`) + `api/BannedSymbols.txt`; the doc admits it at `:10–12`. The other 55 lines are the unenforced stance taxonomy |
| `CODE_CONVENTIONS.md:396` logging | 8 lines, stated a 3rd time at `api/AGENTS.md:3` | `CA1848` = error, build-enforced, 0 violations |
| `CODE_PATTERNS.md:90` keyed strategies | 90 lines | `DealStrategyArchitectureTests.cs` (4 tests) + composition-time `RequireAll`/`RequireExactly` |
| `RESULT_PATTERN.md:605` "Do not introduce" + `:81` boundary rules | 36 lines | `ReunionArchitectureTests.cs`, `TypedResultArchitectureTests.cs` (8 tests) |
| `CODE_CONVENTIONS.md:116` read-context singularity | 15 lines | `RepositoryArchitectureTests.cs` (2 tests) |
| Root `AGENTS.md:213` Docker health | **32 always-loaded lines** | `scripts/docker-health.ps1`, run as an automatic gate by `scripts/e2e.ps1` — `:241` says so itself |
| Root `AGENTS.md:102` + `:123` merge | **86 always-loaded lines, 2 bash blocks** | The `/merge` skill; `:107` and `:202` both say "`/merge` does it for you" |

Two asymmetries worth fixing while here:

- **`MA0053` sealing and file-scoped namespaces are enforced at error severity but documented in no
  prose file** — only in `.editorconfig` comments. Enforcement without a written rule.
- **Several `severity = error` style rules are IDE-only.** There is no `EnforceCodeStyleInBuild`
  property anywhere under `api/**`, so the private-field naming rule (`.editorconfig:31–33`),
  `IDE0130` (`:5`) and file-scoped namespaces (`:4`) do **not** fail a build. The 27 lines of prose at
  `CODE_CONVENTIONS.md:5–31` are therefore doing real work, and the `error` severity oversells itself.
  Setting `EnforceCodeStyleInBuild` would let that prose shrink to a line.

## Dangling and misdirected references

| Source | Target | Status |
|---|---|---|
| root `AGENTS.md:227`, `:241`×2, `:244` | `./e2e.ps1`, `./docker-health.ps1` | Absent at root |
| root `AGENTS.md:275` | `plans/AGENTS.md` "Companion progress ledger" | Section is in `plans/agents/PLAN.md:17` |
| `api/ARCHITECTURE.md:95`, `:219` | `plans/PAYMENT_AGNOSTIC_AUDIT.md` | Absent |
| `api/ARCHITECTURE.md:191` | `plans/PLATFORM_PACKAGE_SYNC.md` | Absent |
| `api/agents/CONVENTIONS.md:55`, `:60` | `feedback_module_impl_visibility_cascade.md`, `feedback_module_facade_surface.md` | Absent repo-wide |
| `.agents/skills/review/SKILL.md:128`, `:151` | `api/agents/MODULAR_MONOLITH_RULES.md` | **Renamed** in `7908c97ed` — rename collateral, breaks a skill lens |
| `api/agents/CONVENTIONS.md:142` | "See CLAUDE.md" | Pathless; that file is one `@AGENTS.md` line |
| `CODE_PATTERNS.md:260` | "the rule in `api/CLAUDE.md`" | Section is `api/AGENTS.md:16` |
| `CODE_CONVENTIONS.md:196` heading | "policy in root `CLAUDE.md`" | Heading and its own link (`:198` → `../../AGENTS.md`) disagree |
| `E2E_CONVENTIONS.md:29` | `E2E_BASELINE.md` | Bare name; only resolvable at `api/Concertable.Shared/tests/Concertable.Testing.E2E/` |
| `app/agents/CODE_PATTERNS.md:276` + 4 more | `axios.tsx`, `b2bAxios.ts`, `tenantChoice.ts`, a missing `schemas/` folder, the auth persona union | All absent or already fixed |
| `api/agents/CONVENTIONS.md:3`, `:106` | `/api/docs/MM_NORTH_STAR.md` | Root-absolute — renders broken, and fools the reachability hook |

None of these are caught by anything today, because the hook does not check target existence.

## The naming collision

`MODULAR_MONOLITH_RULES.md` → `api/agents/CONVENTIONS.md` (in `7908c97ed`) put two files named
`CONVENTIONS.md` and `CODE_CONVENTIONS.md` side by side, and dropped the only word that told them
apart. `api/AGENTS.md:97` rendered as a bare `See [CONVENTIONS.md](./agents/CONVENTIONS.md)` under
`## Module rules` — the filename gives no hint it is layer/project topology, and "CONVENTIONS" reads as
the *superset* of "CODE_CONVENTIONS", which is backwards.

The underlying three-way split is actually clean and worth keeping: **where code lives** (`CONVENTIONS.md`
— projects, layers, visibility, module boundaries) / **how it's named** (`CODE_CONVENTIONS.md`) /
**what structures to use** (`CODE_PATTERNS.md`). Only the name is wrong. `MODULE_STRUCTURE.md` fixes
both the collision and the stale "Applies to modules in the monolith" framing at `:6`/`:91`, which
contradicts `api/ARCHITECTURE.md:8` "LOCK THIS IN".

## The two obsolete architecture docs

Authority is already settled, inside the doc being demoted —
`api/docs/MICROSERVICES_ARCHITECTURE.md:509`: *"`api/ARCHITECTURE.md` is the canonical current-state
doc; this doc records the design and its decision history."*

- **`api/docs/MICROSERVICES_NORTH_STAR.md`** (83) claims at `:3` to be "**The canonical vision… Read
  this first**", is reachable only from a checked-off task line in a plan, and is contradicted four
  ways: 6 services / 11 hosts vs 5 / 9 (`:41`); "shared code lives in two csprojs only, no third
  package" (`:36`) vs the reversal in §4.8 and 11 shared projects on disk; "no NuGet feed maintenance"
  (`:56`) vs `api/ARCHITECTURE.md:105` "executed, not aspirational"; and the Notification error.
- **`api/docs/MM_NORTH_STAR.md`** (423) describes the pre-microservices monolith — in-process bus
  (`:335`), `SharedDbContext.Genres` (deleted per §4.6), `Modules/Identity` (doesn't exist), four
  missing plan citations. **It is one hop from an auto-loaded file**: `api/CLAUDE.md` → `api/AGENTS.md:97`
  → `api/agents/CONVENTIONS.md:3` and `:106`, which present it as the authority for *why*. Parts of its
  corollary text have been retrofitted to current reality, which makes it read as maintained.

## The organizing axes

Four axes are currently collapsed into a vague pair of filenames. Separate them and "where does this
rule go?" becomes a lookup.

| Axis | Values | Encoded by |
|---|---|---|
| **Scope** | universal · api-wide · one service · one project type | **which `AGENTS.md` `@`-imports the topic file** |
| **Genericity** | generic (belongs in the shared repo) · Concertable-specific | **repo** (`conventions/` submodule vs the consumer's own `agents/`) |
| **Kind** | style · naming · structure · testing · process | **filename — one topic per file** |
| **Audience** | human-consultable convention · agent-process instruction | `conventions/` vs `docs/process/` |

**Scope governs bloat, and a folder cannot express it — only an import edge can.** A topic file under
`api/conventions/` still loads for every service that touches `api/**`. The fix is granular topic files
plus per-consumer composition: the file exists once, generic, and only the `AGENTS.md` of a consumer
that actually needs it imports it.

The repo already does this in 42 files — every test project's `AGENTS.md` is a two-line stub that
`@`-imports exactly one of `UNIT_CONVENTIONS.md` / `INTEGRATION_CONVENTIONS.md`. Generalizing that
precedent to every topic is the model.

Measured scope violations in the currently always-loaded set:

| Topic | Lines | Consumers that can use it |
|---|---|---|
| `CODE_PATTERNS.md` "Tenancy is composed, never subtracted" | 62 | B2B only (`TenantScopedDbContext`, `VenueArtistTenantScopedDbContext`, `AdminDbContext`) |
| `CODE_PATTERNS.md` "Module-local keyed strategy factory" | 90 | B2B only (`IDealStrategyFactory`, `DealType`) |
| `RESULT_PATTERN.md` "gRPC boundaries" | 34 | Payment only |
| `CODE_CONVENTIONS.md` proto naming + proto mapper example | ~12 | Payment only — exactly one `.proto` exists in the repo |

~200 lines that four of the five services can never act on, on every `api/**` prompt. Genuinely api-wide
by contrast: `Log.cs` (7 services), `Schema.cs` (7), `IPagination` (6), `IGeometryProvider` (5),
`IUnitOfWorkBehavior` (3), `ValidationResult` (3).

Two distinct defects fall out, with different fixes — don't conflate them:

- **A generic rule carrying local examples** (`base.` qualification illustrated with `CurrentTenant`,
  `XMappers` illustrated with `EscrowDeposit`). The rule is portable; genericize the example.
- **A genuinely single-service topic** (tenancy composition, keyed `DealType` strategies, proto). The
  whole topic is scoped; it becomes its own file, imported only by that service.

**Corollary — generic topic files are exempt from doc locality.** Root `AGENTS.md` "Doc locality" places
a doc at the lowest node containing its concern; that governs *Concertable-specific* guidance. A generic
convention is not *about* any node, it is a library entry addressed by import rather than by position.
Locality still governs the thin local files that name precedents.

## The shared repo: `.agents/`-canonical skills

The monorepo is temporary, so the generic half must not live inside it — otherwise every future
carve-out is an import rewrite.

**The mechanism is not Nx** — Nx is a JS/TS task graph and build cache and distributes nothing to other
repos. Nor is it a Claude Code plugin marketplace *by itself*: take the idea from
`Infonetica/standards-docs` (*"standards distributed to every repo as versioned, load-on-demand skills"*),
not its Claude-only layout. **`.agents/skills/<topic>/SKILL.md` is canonical**, the same
agent-agnostic convention this repo and `dotagents` already use, and the Claude-side paths are generated
stubs:

```text
.agents/skills/<topic>/SKILL.md       the real instructions — one topic per skill
.agents/sync-claude-skill-stubs.ps1   regenerates every stub from them
.claude/skills/<topic>/SKILL.md       generated stub (Claude Code, repo-local)
plugins/<plugin>/skills/<topic>/      generated stub (Claude Code, installed plugin)
.claude-plugin/marketplace.json       the marketplace manifest
```

The skill inventory is in "Target structure" below — it is the live one, so it is not restated here.

Two consumption paths off one source, so nothing is Claude-only: a Claude Code repo installs the plugin
(`/plugin marketplace add <owner>/agent-standards`), while Codex and anything else reads `.agents/skills/`
directly — junctioned, cloned, or synced to `~/.agents/skills/`. **No submodule, no `submodules: true` in
CI, and no import path a carve-out would rewrite.**

**The `description` front-matter is the load-bearing part.** It is the router that decides whether the
skill loads, so it must name both the content and the trigger — the Infonetica `standards-docs` skills do this
well: *"…Use when writing, reviewing, or restructuring backend tests, adding tests for a new endpoint…"*.
A vague description means the skill silently never loads.

### The one thing a skill cannot do — and the tier that follows

A skill is load-on-demand, so it applies **only if it gets invoked**. That is the whole token win and
also the whole risk, and it decides where each rule belongs:

| Tier | Mechanism | Cost | Guarantee |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cross-project always-on | global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (already exists) | every prompt, every repo | unconditional |
| Repo hard floor | that repo's `AGENTS.md` | every prompt in the repo | unconditional |
| Reference standard | plugin skill from `agent-standards` | ~one listing line until invoked | only when invoked |

**Sort by the cost of missing the rule, not by topic.** A rule whose violation is expensive and silent
stays in `AGENTS.md`: never seed handler-written rows, never `WaitFor` another data service, shared code
is the intersection, comments default to none. A rule you consult *while already doing the work* becomes
a skill, because the task itself is the trigger: proto mappers, result-pattern detail, testing shape,
tenancy composition, keyed strategies.

Convenient consequence: the hard floor is mostly Concertable-specific anyway (seed entity inventory,
service topology), so it was never a candidate for the shared repo. The tiers fall out cleanly.

### Per-service composition

Each service keeps a thin `CODE_CONVENTIONS.md` / `CODE_PATTERNS.md` that names the skills relevant to
it and carries its own precedents — the roster of real types the generic skill deliberately omits.

**Mechanical trap:** nested `AGENTS.md` files *compose* — the parent and the child both load. So a
service file must carry **only its extras**, never a copy of the api-wide baseline list. Five services
each restating the baseline is five copies that drift, which is the defect this whole plan exists to
remove.

## Target structure

A **skill is a convention doc with a trigger** — the same markdown, plus a `description` front-matter
that decides when it loads. So nothing is rewritten into a different genre; generic topics move to
`Concertable/agent-standards` and gain a description, while what must always apply stays in-repo.

**Two homes, split by whether the rule names this product** — DONE, 36 skills. Both repos keep `.agents/skills/`
canonical and generate the Claude-side stubs from it, so nothing is Claude-only and Codex reads the same files.

- **`tomjseery/dotagents` → `~/.agents/skills/`** — the 28 generic ones. They name no project, so they are
  personal and every repo on the machine has them with no per-repo install.
- **`Concertable/agent-standards`** — the 7 process ones, which are Concertable-shaped: the merge queue and
  its platform-sync PR, the draft-PR/queue tiering, ROADMAP→PLAN→PROGRESS and the worktree scripts. In the
  org so carve-out service repos inherit them.

```text
dotagents  .agents/skills/     -> ~/.agents/skills/    (personal, generic, 28)

  git-branching/  committing/  remote-validation/  merging/  plans/
  docs-and-debt/  failing-tests/
```

**A description is the router, and a bare colon-space breaks it.** An unquoted YAML scalar truncates at
`: `, so a description containing one leaves the skill with nothing to route on and it never loads — with
no visible error. Two migrated skills shipped that way; the stub generator now fails instead of emitting an
unroutable stub.

Two departures from the earlier sketch, both from applying the tier table above rather than the topic list:

- **`git-hygiene`/`merge-confirmation`/`branch-currency` became `git-branching`/`committing`/`merging`.**
  Branch currency is a pre-step of enabling auto-merge, not a topic of its own, so it belongs inside
  `merging` with the confirm loop it gates. Committing is a genuinely separate trigger from branching.
- **No `reviews` skill.** There is no generic review standard to migrate: `.agents/skills/review/SKILL.md`
  is lenses pointed at this repo's own docs, which is local by construction.

And two topics deliberately **not** migrated, because a load-on-demand skill is the wrong tier for them:
"questions come before actions" and "act on reversible work" are always-applicable behavioural rules whose
violation is silent — the task would have to summon the skill, and by then the miss has happened. They stay
in the global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, as does the comment *policy*; only the C# mechanics of comments and
XML doc became a skill.

**Staying in Concertable:**

```text
AGENTS.md                       the repo hard floor + docs/INDEX.md pointer
docs/INDEX.md                   topic -> owner, incl. which skill owns which topic
api/AGENTS.md                   api-wide floor: seeding trigger rule, service topology,
                                shared-is-the-intersection, migrations
api/ARCHITECTURE.md             authoritative current state
api/Concertable.<Service>/
  CODE_CONVENTIONS.md           thin: this service's precedents + relevant skills
  CODE_PATTERNS.md              thin: same
  AGENTS.md / ARCHITECTURE.md   unchanged
app/  same shape
```

The per-service files carry the roster the generic skill deliberately omits — B2B's context roster and
filtered-entity list, Payment's Refit client roster and money conventions, the `DealType` families.

**Mechanical trap:** nested `AGENTS.md` files *compose* — parent and child both load. A service file
carries **only its extras**, never a copy of the api-wide floor, or five services drift five ways.

## The meta-rules

Landed in `docs/INDEX.md` (for this repo) and the `agent-standards` README (for the shared half). These
generalize what the repo already states in two places — `.agents/README.md` ("duplicated skill bodies
drift") and `RESULT_PATTERN.md:4` ("sole source of truth").

1. **One rule, one home.** Everywhere else links; never restates. A second copy is a bug.
2. **No file straddles the shared repo and the consumer repo.** A shared skill contains no Concertable
   identifier; concrete precedents live in the consumer's own `agents/` doc.
3. **If a machine enforces it, the doc gets one line and the diagnostic/test name.** Before writing a
   style rule, check whether `.editorconfig` or an architecture test can hold it.
4. **Headings are imperative rule statements, not topic labels.**
5. **≤15 lines per rule** — statement, anti-pattern, one example. Past ~80 lines it earns its own file;
   under ~20 lines a file merges into its parent.
6. **Never name violation sites in a rule doc.** They rot. Violations go in the owning `TECH_DEBT.md`.
7. **A doc is either `@`-imported or summarized — never both.** If a rule matters enough to restate
   inline, import it; if it doesn't, link it and cut the summary.
8. **Links are repo-relative.** No root-absolute `/api/...` paths.

## Phases

### Phase 1 — index and meta-rules, nothing moves — DONE
`docs/INDEX.md` mapping topic → owning file; the two `conventions/README.md` files. Reviewable against
the current tree.

### Phase 2 — factual fixes (separately committed) — DONE
Contradictions 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8 (evidence-settled) and 9; all 12 dangling/misdirected references
including `review/SKILL.md:128`, `:151`; delete `CODE_CONVENTIONS.md:192–194`; the five stale app-side
citations; the `./scripts/` path fixes across root `AGENTS.md` and the four e2e skills; the
`integration-debug` Docker floor.

### Phase 3a — move the corpus out to `.agents`-canonical skills — DONE
36 skills, split by whether the rule names this product: 29 generic to `dotagents` (`~/.agents/skills/`),
7 Concertable process ones to `Concertable/agent-standards`. Examples genericized off any single project's
domain; `proto`'s mapper and payload-naming sections collapsed to pointers rather than restating
`csharp-naming`.

### Phase 3b — reduce the in-repo half to the hard floor — DONE
`api/agents/*` 1,986 → 349 lines and `app/agents/*` 752 → 118, with every surviving file naming the skills
that own its generic half and carrying only this repo's roster. `UNIT_CONVENTIONS.md`,
`DEBUGGING_CONVENTIONS.md`, `E2E_CONVENTIONS.md` and `MICROSERVICE_COMMUNICATION.md` deleted, their local
remnants folded into `Concertable.Testing.E2E/AGENTS.md` and `api/ARCHITECTURE.md`;
`CONVENTIONS.md` → `MODULE_STRUCTURE.md` with the monolith framing fixed. B2B's scoped topics (context
stances, filtered entities, `DealType` families, workflow steps) moved to
`api/Concertable.B2B/CODE_PATTERNS.md`, imported only by B2B — so four of the five services stop paying for
them. 17 unit-test stubs and 6 E2E stubs now name their skill instead of importing a file.

One rule was **kept in repo rather than cut**: "one repository per entity", which landed on `main` mid-phase
and no skill owns yet. Cutting it would have deleted a live rule; it is a promotion candidate for
`persistence`.

### Phase 3c — the markdown outside the two conventions folders
10,011 lines of markdown live outside `plans/`, `reviews/`, `api/agents/` and `app/agents/`. Most of it is
domain knowledge already sitting in the right place — per-service `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `LEGAL_REQUIREMENTS.md`,
the `TECH_DEBT.md` set, `E2E_BASELINE.md`, `BROWSER_STORAGE.md` — and is not touched. What needs a decision:

| File | Lines | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| `app/README.md` | 73 | Still the unmodified Vite scaffold, describing ESLint config the repo doesn't use. Replace with the tier map. |
| `notes/Concert-Rust-Analysis.md` | 444 | Orphan analysis, referenced by nothing. Delete per the throwaway-markdown rule, or give it a home. |
| `api/docs/MICROSERVICES_ARCHITECTURE.md` | 525 | Self-declared subordinate to `api/ARCHITECTURE.md`, stale-dated. Keep as dated history or fold and delete. |
| `api/docs/VS_TEST_EXPLORER_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` | 51 | Duplicate of the `reset-test-explorer` skill. One owner, one pointer. |
| `docs/USP.md`, `docs/DEEP_RESEARCH_PROMPT_GUIDE.md`, `docs/OVERVIEW.md` | 319 | All orphaned. `OVERVIEW.md` is the clearest "what is Concertable" anywhere and nothing links it — link it from root. |
| `api/docs/` as a tree | — | After 3b it holds only the two files above. Collapse it; two parallel doc trees in one service tree with no stated distinction is the original defect. |

**Settled (was: "settle before 3b edits root `AGENTS.md`").** The merge-confirmation loop exists in root
`AGENTS.md`, in `.agents/skills/merge/SKILL.md` which *automates* it, and in the `merging` standards skill.
The ruling: **the executable in-repo skill owns the procedure** — it knows this repo's real labels, workflows
and commands — while root `AGENTS.md` keeps only the invariants whose violation is expensive and silent (never
enable auto-merge on a stale branch; a failed check is a real failure, never retried or toggled; never
`Monitor`; whoever merges owns the platform-sync PR), one line each pointing at the skill. The `merging`
standards skill stays as the *generic* standard for carve-out repos that will not have this repo's `merge`
skill, and must be reduced to the rule without the loop body. Same shape for `pr-preflight` and `review`.

3b did **not** need this ruling after all: it never edited root `AGENTS.md`'s merge or Docker blocks, because
the plan already defers auto-load thinning to a follow-up PR. Executing the ruling belongs to that PR (root
side) and to Next Step 4 (standards-skill side).

### Phase 4 — dedupe to one home
Collapse each duplication row. Biggest win: seeding from 5 locations to the `seeding` skill (the principle)
plus one in-repo seed inventory (the forbidden-table list), with `api/AGENTS.md:26–45` becoming a pointer —
resolved under meta-rule 7 by deciding import-or-pointer, not both. Same treatment for the 5 app-side
double-writes, which currently load twice. Runs after 3b: dedupeing into files 3b then restructures would
edit the same lines twice.

### Phase 5 — the shared repos become a browsable tree, not a flat skill list

**Decided 2026-08-17.** Phase 3a landed 36 skills as flat sibling directories. That is fine for the
router and bad for a human: a listing of `write-boundary`, `contract-naming`, `tiered-shared-code`,
`stack-defaults` answers "what exists?" only if you already know the answer. Tommy's actual question —
*"did I document this, and where is it?"* — has no cheap way to be asked, and this plan's own execution
proves the cost: three gaps (page-object/`data-testid` shape, "tests must pass in isolation", "one
repository per entity") were found by accident while cutting an unrelated file, not by inspection.
Nothing about a flat list would ever have surfaced them.

So invert the two: **the doc is the payload and the skill is the router**, and organize the payload as a
tree. This applies to *everything* in the shared repos — process and runbooks as much as conventions —
not just the convention topics.

```text
conventions/
  testing/{e2e,integration,unit}/E2E.md, INTEGRATION.md, UNIT.md
  csharp/{style,naming,comments}/…
  react/{structure,server-state,client-state}/…
skills/<topic>/SKILL.md        thin router -> the doc, one level deep (a discovery constraint)
```

Skills stay flat because discovery is `<root>/skills/*/SKILL.md` and does not recurse; only the content
moves into the tree. Three consequences, all wanted: the tree is browsable and diffable, a gap is
visible as a missing node, and the same doc gains two delivery modes — `@`-imported by a repo that wants
it always-on, routed by the skill everywhere else. Content in a `SKILL.md` can only ever be delivered
one way.

- **Split `dotagents` by stack.** The .NET set and the TS/React set (9 skills, 671 lines) are
  independent; a Spring Boot + React repo should get one without the other. Both still sync to
  `~/.agents/skills/`, so consumption is unchanged.
- **Do not name every leaf `CONVENTIONS.md`.** Twenty identically-named files defeat tabs, grep and
  review. The topic goes in the filename. This repo already paid twice: `CODE_CONVENTIONS.md` vs
  `CODE_PATTERNS.md` was the original "where does this rule go?" failure, and Phase 3b had to rename
  `CONVENTIONS.md` → `MODULE_STRUCTURE.md` to clear a collision.
- **Mandatory machine check — the tree must not grow orphans.** Every doc must have exactly one routing
  skill and every skill must point at a doc that exists. Two structures that can drift is precisely how
  754 lines of frontend law ended up with zero inbound links, unread until a shipped feature violated
  it. Both halves of the pattern already exist: `docs_reachability.py` and the stub generator that
  refuses to emit an unroutable stub.
- **Generated per-repo index.** The tree answers "where is it"; an index generated from the tree
  answers "did I document this" without opening anything.

Sequenced after this PR merges: the Concertable-side pointers get rewritten once, against the final
structure, instead of twice.

### Phase 6 — make consultation non-optional, because triage is not a guarantee

**Added 2026-08-17, after a live failure.** The plan already names the risk — a skill "applies **only if
it gets invoked**", and the tier table's guarantee column says exactly that. Its answer was *triage*: put
the expensive-and-silent rules in `AGENTS.md` and let the rest be skills. **That answer is now disproven.**
An agent added a test to `Concertable.ServiceDefaults` and got four things wrong at once — created
`Concertable.ServiceDefaults.Tests` (neither `*.UnitTests` nor `*.IntegrationTests`), booted a
`WebApplication` over HTTP inside what it called a unit test, used `Assert.*` where the integration tier
uses Shouldly, and wrote no sibling `AGENTS.md`. `unit-testing` and `integration-testing` were both
installed, both described, both listed. Neither was invoked, and the follow-up `/review` repeated the
identical blind spot and returned clean.

So the failure was **discretion, not reachability**, and no amount of better pointing fixes it. Three
tiers, in this order:

1. **Build-time is the guarantee.** Every service already has a `Directory.Build.props` that wires the
   shared `api/BannedSymbols.txt` into `AdditionalFiles` for `BannedApiAnalyzers` — the seam already
   trusted at error severity for `RS0030`. A shared targets file, imported the same one-line way, adds:
   a **tier-naming gate** (`IsTestProject == true` and no `UnitTests`/`IntegrationTests`/`E2ETests`/
   `ArchitectureTests` segment → error), a **misclassification gate** (a `*.UnitTests` project
   referencing `Mvc.Testing`, `TestHost`, `Testcontainers.*`, `Respawn`, `Playwright`, `Reqnroll` →
   error), and a per-tier `BannedSymbols.UnitTests.txt` catching `WebApplicationFactory<T>`/`TestServer`/
   `WebApplication.CreateBuilder` in source, which a package check misses on a transitive reference.
   `<IsTestProject>` is already explicit and correct in 51 csprojs (`false` in the 12 support libs), so
   there is nothing to infer. **Measured: zero current violations of all three, so this lands at error
   severity with no migration.** Must execute as a `<Target>`, not props logic — `Directory.Build.props`
   is imported before the csproj body, so `$(IsTestProject)` is not yet set there.
2. **A PreToolUse skill router for fast feedback and context injection** — `.agents/hooks/skill_router.py`
   over `Write|Edit|MultiEdit`, driven by a checked-in path→skill table (`*.UnitTests/**/*.cs` →
   `unit-testing`; `*Repository.cs` → `persistence` + `multitenancy`; `*.proto` → `proto`;
   `app/**/api/*.ts` → `http-layer` + `contract-naming`; a test csproj → both testing skills, because
   that is the classification moment). It injects the owning doc on first touch and blocks a fingerprint
   hit. **This is the piece that generalizes to anything: a new concern is a new row, not another
   paragraph nobody reads.** Same table should drive `/review`, which is how that blind spot closes
   mechanically instead of by remembering.
   **Its coverage is genuinely leaky and that is why it is tier 2, not tier 1:** matchers are per-tool, so
   `dotnet new`, a Bash heredoc or an MCP file write never reach a `Write` matcher, and it binds only a
   harness wired to it. Injection also is not compliance. Only the decidable set can be guaranteed.
3. **The stub leads with the decision, not the pointer.** `Conventions: the unit-testing skill` names a
   standard; what was needed was the unasked question, at the point of use — *"Unit-only: a test that
   needs a host, HTTP or a database belongs in `<Service>.IntegrationTests`."* And
   `docs_reachability.py` should require every `IsTestProject` directory to carry the `AGENTS.md` +
   `CLAUDE.md` pair, which removes "there was no stub at all" as a reachable state — the hole that made
   the `@`-import argument moot, since the incident folder had no `AGENTS.md` for an import to live in.

**Deliberately not mechanized: test method names.** Measured 1,062 unit-test methods; **256 (24%) do not
use the 3-part `Method_Scenario_ExpectedBehaviour` form** (`Map_ProjectsEveryItem`,
`CancelledSourceTasks_RemainCancelled`), most of them reasonable. A gate needs a 256-site migration first,
and the skill is overstating a rule the repo follows ~76% of the time. It belongs in the injected
standard, not in a blocker. Gating everything is how a gate gets switched off.

**Ordering consequence — this phase gates Phase 3b's delivery.** Thinning the in-repo corpus to
skill pointers must not merge before the mechanism that makes those skills fire, or the window between
them is exactly the incident above. Phase 6 rides the same PR.

### Phase 6a — the shared skills are deployed by copy, and the copies had drifted

`~/.agents/skills/` is a **plain directory of copies** — not a junction, not a clone — so nothing links
an installed skill to its canonical source and nothing detects divergence. Verified state on 2026-08-17:

- **`agent-standards` is installed nowhere.** Not in `~/.agents/skills/`, not in `~/.claude/skills/`;
  `installed_plugins.json` holds only `stripe`, `clangd-lsp`, `rust-analyzer-lsp`, and
  `known_marketplaces.json` only `claude-plugins-official` — despite the repo carrying a valid
  `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` declaring the `agent-process` plugin. So Phase 3a's "36 skills"
  is **29 in reality**, and the 7 process skills are unreachable from every session, by every agent.
- **Two installed skills were ahead of canonical and were nearly lost.** `prune-worktrees` (+34 lines,
  the sweep of orphaned leftover folders `git worktree list` is structurally blind to) and `worktree`
  (+17, the Windows "stand in the main checkout before deleting, then verify" footgun) existed **only**
  as loose installed files, edited 2026-08-10 against a repo still at its 2026-08-08 initial commit.
  Recovered into `dotagents` `c153697`; installed and canonical now agree on all 36. **A junction-based
  redeploy done without checking direction first would have destroyed both.**
- **3 canonical skills are not installed** — `last-conversation`, `recents`, `search`.

Fix the mechanism, not the symptom: **per-skill directory junctions** from `~/.agents/skills/<name>` and
`~/.claude/skills/<name>` to the owning repo, so a `git pull` is the deployment and drift is structurally
impossible. Per-skill rather than one junction at `skills/` because discovery is `<root>/skills/*/SKILL.md`
and does not recurse, and because two source repos must land in one namespace. It is also the idiom
already used for the work-repo skills. One stated trade-off: junctions make the installed set depend on
the repo staying put, and a deploy script must therefore also report orphaned and missing links.

### Deferred to follow-up PRs
Auto-load thinning (`api/AGENTS.md:3`'s three imports; the 86 merge lines and 32 Docker lines that
`/merge` and `scripts/e2e.ps1` already automate); the analyzer push-down plus
`EnforceCodeStyleInBuild`; extraction of `portable/`.

The `docs_reachability.py` extension moved forward into Phase 2 rather than being deferred: without a
machine check, the nine dangling references fixed there simply accumulate again. It now errors on a
guidance doc that links a non-existent file or uses a root-absolute path, and warns for `plans/` and
`reviews/`, which are working docs that get deleted. It skips fenced blocks — a shell regex like
`[/\](bin|obj)[/\]` matches the markdown link pattern and is not a link.

## Open decisions

All Phase 1–2 rulings are settled (see the contradictions table). The `CONVENTIONS.md` →
`MODULE_STRUCTURE.md` rename **has happened** in Phase 3b, along with the fix to its stale "modules in the
monolith" framing; the three-copy merge-procedure question is settled above.

Codex parity, previously listed here as a gate on Phase 3b, was never a real one: the existing `.agents/`
convention already solves it. Canonical skills are plain markdown under `.agents/skills/`, agent-agnostic
by construction, and `dotagents` syncs them to `~/.agents/skills/`, which a Codex session reads. Claude Code
gets generated stubs. Phase 3b cuts nothing that either tool then lacks.

Still open:

1. **Auto-load budget** — Phase 5 would drop `api/AGENTS.md:3`'s three `@`-imports (1,331 lines) and
   the always-loaded merge/Docker blocks that `/merge` and `scripts/e2e.ps1` already automate. Is
   dropping `RESULT_PATTERN.md` from every-prompt load acceptable given it is the most-violated set?
