# Concertable — root technical debt

Debt that is genuinely repo-wide: `.github/workflows/**` gating logic, root-level docs/config, or
anything spanning both `api/` and `app/`. Backend-only cross-cutting debt (multiple services, host
`Program.cs` files) belongs in [`api/TECH_DEBT.md`](./api/TECH_DEBT.md); frontend-only cross-cutting
debt in [`app/web/TECH_DEBT.md`](./app/web/TECH_DEBT.md) / [`app/shared/TECH_DEBT.md`](./app/shared/TECH_DEBT.md).
Service- or tier-specific debt belongs in that area's own `TECH_DEBT.md`.
