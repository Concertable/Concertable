r"""PreToolUse hook: the file you are about to write decides which standard you must read.

The failure this exists for: an agent added a test, never invoked `unit-testing` or
`integration-testing` though both were installed and listed, misclassified the test, and its own
`/review` repeated the blind spot and returned clean. Nothing was unreachable. The standard was
optional, and optional lost.

So the trigger stops being "the model decided this topic is relevant" and becomes "the path being
written". `.agents/skill-routes.json` maps path -> owning skill; a new concern is a new row there.

Three behaviours, and the difference matters:

- **First write into a routed path in a session -> block once** with the owning skills and their own
  descriptions, then allow every later write to that route. PreToolUse has no way to add context
  without stopping the call, and stopping once is the point: it puts the standard in context *before*
  the file exists, which costs one tool call and removes the discretion. State lives in a per-session
  file, so it is one interruption per route, not per edit.
- **A deny pattern -> block every time.** Those are mechanically decidable violations, so they are not
  advice. A repo whose rules are also expressible in its build should enforce them there too - a hook
  matcher is per-tool and never sees `dotnet new`, a shell heredoc or an MCP write.
- **A routed skill with no SKILL.md anywhere -> block every time, never once-and-allow.** The
  block-once contract only makes sense when the block is dischargeable: read the skill, then the route
  is satisfied. A missing skill has nothing to read, so the one-time notice was observed to fail
  exactly the way a deny pattern would if it only fired once - an agent reads "NOT INSTALLED", has no
  standard to load in response, and the next write to that route sails through with the skill still
  unread, silently, for the rest of the session. Distinguishing "installed, not yet read" from "not
  installed at all" and gating only the first on session state is the fix; the second stays a hard
  stop, same tier as a deny pattern, until the deployment fault - a missing plugin, or a route naming a
  skill that no longer resolves - is actually fixed.

Contract: exit 0 = allow, exit 2 = block with stderr fed back to the agent. Anything unexpected exits
0 - a broken router must not wedge every write, since a build gate is the tier that guarantees.

The same table also answers the question after the fact: `--skills-for <paths>` (or paths on stdin)
prints which skills a set of changed files obliges a reader to load. That is what a review runs, so a
review cannot miss what its author was required to load - the other half of the failure above, where
the follow-up review repeated the identical blind spot and returned clean.

Ships in the `agent-process` plugin, so both harnesses run this one file. They share the exit-2 block
contract but NOT the payload: Claude sends a PascalCase tool name and one path under `file_path`,
while Codex sends `apply_patch` with the paths named inside the patch body. Matching only Claude's
shape is not a partial rollout - it is a hook that allows every Codex write while looking wired. A
repo opts in by carrying `.agents/skill-routes.json`; without one the hook exits 0 and does nothing.
