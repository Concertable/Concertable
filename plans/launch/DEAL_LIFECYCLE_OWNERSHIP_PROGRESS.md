- Roadmap item: `launch/deal-lifecycle-ownership`
- Worktree: `C:\Users\TommySeery\source\repos\Concertable\.worktrees\Refactor-launch_deal-lifecycle-modules`
- Branch: `Refactor/launch_deal-lifecycle-modules`
- PR: draft implementation PR [#625](https://github.com/Concertable/concertable/pull/625) at verified reviewed work head `1457a2508db5b69d5a0fa7f05eea78ba412edd76`; docs-only decision PR #622 merged as `5c33f849444dda60ece44070353716c08819b2d8`; rejected PR #614 is closed and retired
- Dependency/package gates: Phase 1 characterization and review are complete. Replacement exact-head draft-PR CI must pass after removing the vacuous architecture guard, then PR #625 can enter the merge queue. Phase 2 has not started.
- Last reconciled: 2026-08-17 after publishing and incrementally reviewing the architecture-guard correction

## Current state

Tommy approved the target ownership design on 2026-08-16. The fixed progression is Application →
Booking → Concert for every `DealType`; DealType varies only the local behaviour performed at each
stage. Opportunity remains the upstream one-Deal/many-Applications aggregate.

Application, Booking, and Concert will become independent modules with their own state, transition
model, contextual step contracts, and module-local step resolver. There is no umbrella process entity,
shared lifecycle state, workflow module, cross-module resolver, or parent state machine. A combined
status exists only as a read projection.

Phase 1 characterization is complete. Existing integration coverage already pins both
payment/Accept arrival orders, payment failures, pre- and post-Concert cancellation, late-capture
compensation, immutable Contract snapshots, Invoice creation, and duplicate settlement success. The
two missing cases are now covered: payment-webhook redelivery asserts exactly one persisted Concert,
and a failed settlement followed by a successful retry reaches the existing completion outcome. No
new test asserts the legacy shared lifecycle topology, transition table, source layout, or filenames.

The speculative future-module architecture guard was removed because it matched no types before the
modules existed. Phase 2 will add compile-time project boundaries and ArchUnitNET rules against each
real assembly as it is scaffolded. The correction is published and reviewed; replacement exact-head
CI and merge delivery remain before Phase 2 starts.

Rejected PR #614 is closed, and its DealTerms branch and worktree were retired with exact-head checks.
The fresh implementation branch contains only current-main Deal vocabulary; none of the rejected
runtime change was carried forward.

## Next Steps

1. Confirm replacement exact-head draft-PR CI, mark PR #625 ready, and merge it through the queue with
   the mechanically selected E2E tier; follow package publication and platform sync to terminal green.
2. Resume Phase 2 from a fresh plan-managed worktree after PR #625 lands.

## Completed work

- Reconstructed `origin/main` and the rejected aggregate-collapse, premature state-split, and
  Deal-owned workflow attempts.
- Established that the combined `ApplicationEntity.State` is an ownership defect rather than evidence
  for a replacement process aggregate.
- Confirmed from current executors/callbacks that commands consume one lifecycle operation at a time;
  the `IConcertWorkflow` dependency-holder leaks unrelated dependencies.
- Obtained Tommy's explicit decision for independent Application, Booking, and Concert ownership,
  module-local state machines/resolvers, contextual names, and no umbrella parent.
- Replaced the undecided plan with executable phases covering module extraction, state ownership,
  transaction/convergence invariants, local step resolution, projections, and delivery.
- Reconciled the approved decision onto current main, fixed all three docs-review findings, and pushed
  reviewed work head `d06422710a5789cc40ab8817f8ee860f80220eda`; the remote-tracking ref matched exactly.
- Published ledger checkpoint `486ad455bdf2ef4a95034a5401fda0a030f9f7c6`, opened docs-only PR #622,
  and confirmed its PR head and `skip-e2e` label.
- Merged docs decision PR #622 as `5c33f849444dda60ece44070353716c08819b2d8`, closed rejected PR #614,
  and retired its clean worktree/local branch at exact head `ec1dcac897ce5075db83247d05ff694a912f9c43`.
- Published initial work commit `7898bf8bb83f3dff61686044cd49023ed0afb9fc`, merged current
  `origin/main` as `3d0fc5a823cad198f8de878aecef5928036f6c5f`, then pushed range
  `7898bf8bb..3d0fc5a82` from starting remote head `7898bf8bb`.
- Opened draft PR #625 and verified local HEAD, the remote branch, and PR `headRefOid` all equalled
  `3d0fc5a823cad198f8de878aecef5928036f6c5f` before this ledger checkpoint.
- Removed the exact shared-state topology and source/file inventory additions after recognizing they
  asserted the implementation scheduled for deletion rather than durable system behaviour. This
  correction is recorded in this commit.
- Published correction `cea004a225d04e1ce92abb0eac1b061220e2bdc2`, verified local HEAD, the
  remote branch, and PR #625 `headRefOid` matched, and corrected the draft PR title and description.
- Audited Phase 1 boundary coverage and added only the missing settlement-recovery flow and direct
  exactly-once Concert assertion; the existing coverage already protects the other required outcomes.
- Published Phase 1 range `40cd20957..96dd65989`, including current `origin/main` merge
  `96dd6598979313c40214cbf78c69facd25e4b2e7`; local HEAD, the remote branch, and PR #625
  `headRefOid` matched exactly before this ledger checkpoint.
- Reviewed range `40cd20957..2cc20d1be`; replaced the fixture's hand-written handler scope with
  `IScoped<...>.RunAsync`, then verified and published the resolved review work head.
- Exact checkpoint `f3ebb0fc966a30efab227d16d191cb8d8dcb07a4` passed draft-PR CI run
  `31983097059`, including build, every service carve, unit matrix, integration matrix, and `ci-complete`.

## Verification

- `origin/main` uses one broad `LifecycleState` on Application while Booking and Concert have no
  lifecycle state of their own.
- Public Application mapping already collapses post-accept states back to Accepted, proving those later
  states are not meaningful Application status.
- Concert completion currently reaches backwards through `Concert.Booking.Application.State`, the
  dependency leak the target design removes.
- Accept currently forms Application acceptance, Booking, and Contract under one B2B transaction; the
  plan preserves that invariant across module DbContexts.
- Verify-before-Accept convergence already persists the early payment fact before advancing; the plan
  preserves the join without treating it as one end-to-end state.
- Corrected Concert unit suite: 229/229 passed in Release with the branch restored to current-main
  lifecycle test coverage and no new assertion over `LifecycleState` or its transition table.
- `dotnet build api/Concertable.B2B/src/Concertable.B2B.Web/Concertable.B2B.Web.csproj --configuration Release --no-restore`:
  0 errors and the pre-existing `UserEntity` CS0628 warning after merging the current platform pin.
- Rejected DealTerms implementation vocabulary scan: no matches.
- `python .agents/hooks/plan_graph.py --root .`: 0 errors and 0 warnings.
- `git diff --check`: passed.
- Pre-checkpoint publication: local HEAD, `origin/Refactor/launch_deal-lifecycle-modules`, and draft PR
  #625 `headRefOid` all equalled `3d0fc5a823cad198f8de878aecef5928036f6c5f`.
- Correction publication: local HEAD, `origin/Refactor/launch_deal-lifecycle-modules`, and draft PR
  #625 `headRefOid` all equalled `cea004a225d04e1ce92abb0eac1b061220e2bdc2`.
- `dotnet build api/Concertable.B2B/src/Modules/Concert/Tests/Concertable.B2B.Concert.IntegrationTests/Concertable.B2B.Concert.IntegrationTests.csproj --configuration Release`:
  0 errors; the three warnings are pre-existing `UserEntity`/`ConcertApiTests` warnings.
- Current candidate `python .agents/hooks/plan_graph.py --root <worktree>`: 0 errors and 0 warnings;
  `git diff --check`: passed.
- After merging current `origin/main`, the affected integration-test project built with 0 errors and
  two pre-existing nullable warnings.
- Phase 1 work-head publication: local HEAD, `origin/Refactor/launch_deal-lifecycle-modules`, and draft
  PR #625 `headRefOid` all equalled `96dd6598979313c40214cbf78c69facd25e4b2e7`.
- Review-fix publication: local HEAD, `origin/Refactor/launch_deal-lifecycle-modules`, and draft PR #625
  `headRefOid` all equalled `2cc20d1be8bc4e7755d5cc4894f11c159dabd6c7`; the affected integration-test
  project rebuilt with 0 errors after the using-based scoped-dispatch cleanup.
- Exact-head draft-PR CI at checkpoint `f3ebb0fc966a30efab227d16d191cb8d8dcb07a4`: green. The B2B
  Concert integration shard passed in 5m03s, the Concert unit shard passed in 1m14s, and `ci-complete`
  passed.
- Removed the future-module ArchUnitNET rule before delivery because `WithoutRequiringPositiveResults`
  made it vacuous until the module assemblies exist; Phase 2 now owns meaningful boundary enforcement.
- Published corrected work head `1457a2508db5b69d5a0fa7f05eea78ba412edd76`; local HEAD, the remote
  branch, and PR #625 `headRefOid` matched exactly before this review checkpoint.

## Reviews

- Docs review of `89361e99e..d06422710` found three issues: the checkout boundary was ambiguous, the
  typed-result ledger retained a transferred return path, and graph evidence was stale. All were fixed
  in `0bd1d2094`; follow-up review through `d06422710` found no further issues.
- Review `reviews/Refactor-launch_deal-lifecycle-modules.md` covered `40cd20957..1457a2508` across
  correctness, microservice isolation, module boundaries, seeding, C# conventions, and changed-path
  coverage. Its integration-test convention finding and incremental ledger-consistency finding are
  resolved; no open findings remain.

## Decisions, discoveries, blockers, and deviations

- One state machine exists per owning aggregate/module, not per individual enum value.
- Local state machines may use different structures; no common lifecycle interface is required.
- Context supplies names inside a module: `State`, `Trigger`, `StateMachine`, `IStepResolver<TStep>`,
  and `ICancelStep` do not need Application/Booking/Concert prefixes internally.
- Generic keyed-DI or transition plumbing may be shared only when it has no domain knowledge. Strategy
  registrations, transition tables, capabilities, and resolver instances remain module-local.
- Application records pre-accept payment evidence only because the callback can arrive before Booking
  exists. The evidence is not a continuation of Application lifecycle state.
- The fixed progression is an invariant to enforce, not an extension point. A `DealType` cannot skip,
  reorder, or merge Application, Booking, and Concert.
- .NET 11 native unions are the selected mechanism for justified closed internal values after the
  module split, including the combined journey projection and module-local state, trigger, or
  operation-outcome shapes with case-specific data. They do not contain DI services, create shared
  lifecycle ownership, or replace local step resolvers; persistence maps each module's discriminator
  explicitly.
- Rust is not an implementation option for this lifecycle, Deal behaviour, or settlement work. The
  obsolete Rust engine plan was deleted rather than retained as a paused alternative.
- Opportunity is not hidden inside Application. Its physical extraction is part of the module carve.
- Invoice/settlement records require evidence-based final placement during the Concert carve, but they
  cannot justify a shared lifecycle owner.
- A characterization test must survive the refactor it protects. Types, transition tables, filenames,
  source tokens, and collaborator ownership explicitly scheduled for removal belong in migration
  inventory, never in new regression assertions.

## Migration inventory

- Application commands currently run through Apply, Accept, Reject, Withdraw, and application-cancel
  executors; Accept owns the transaction/outbox boundary, Contract issuance, and early-payment join.
- Booking progression currently spans verification, escrow, settlement, refund, and financial-operation
  callbacks, with operation IDs on Application and settlement correlation through Booking.
- Concert completion runs from `ConcertFinishedFunction`; Concert API actions cover update, post,
  cancellation, door revenue, Contract reads, and Invoice reads.
- Application and Opportunity HATEOAS currently derive checkout and command links from the Concert
  workflow capability registry.
- Booking-to-Concert creation currently runs through the book step and draft service; Invoice currently
  reaches DealType through Concert to Booking to Application. These are migration sites, not target
  ownership or test expectations.

## Downstream handoffs

- Waiting plan: `plans/dotnet-11/B2B_WORKFLOW_UNIONS_PROGRESS.md`.
  Gate: this lifecycle implementation must land before the .NET 11 plan applies native unions to the
  resulting closed value shapes; it must not union concrete DI step implementations from the rejected
  god-workflow model.
